Explain why? - I suggest improving the guide, the greatest contribution is in the sequence of incorporation that it proposes. In addition, it should not explain the practice in Observations or differentiate it from other practices in that column, but rather it should give suggestions for how to apply it - In the text it indicates "Later on, three extra practices are also presented..." Which ones are they or did I not read correctly? - According to the format, put at least 5 keywords - I suggest mentioning the practices before showing c each table. - Some references are incomplete, for example, missing year in reference 17, missing year and type of event in reference 11, missing editorial in reference 19 (is it a book?) - Some titles have a comma inside the quotes, example, reference 1",

                    "text": "The authors describe a methodology to collaboratively develop theses and reports using technologies that are commonly used in software development. They also describe specific tools and their benefits, such as Latex and Git. Finally, propose a workflow for the development of projects of this nature.The main value of the article lies in the application of knowledge that students already dominate -that is, software development techniques and tools- to a different problem as is the case of the theses and memoirs. All this, with the aim of making the process more efficient. 1.- The emphasis of the article is the solution without making a detailed analysis of the problem that it is intended to solve. In other words, there are no answers to the following questions: a.- What exactly is the problem? b.- What impacts does this problem generate? c.- Why is it important to solve the problem? d.- What solutions have been implemented? or to date? e.- What advantages does the proposed solution have with respect to the previous ones? 2.- In my opinion, the article should emphasize more the methodology and workflow. For example, adding a diagram -using a visual language- that allows, on the one hand, to understand the general thesis development process and, on the other, to distinguish the roles, activities and associated technologies in each phase of the report. 3.- Some aspects of the language and the rigor of certain statements must be taken care of, such as: \"(given the rather atrocious spelling enjoyed by engineers)\". Do the authors have any empirical support to support this claim? Is it necessary to resort to such prosaic language to justify the convenience of using a certain technological tool? By the way, I recommend reviewing the expressions: \"it is not public\" (point 3.1) and \"Having access directly...\" (point 3.2)",

                    "text": "This paper involves the development of an application that simulates the BB84 protocol, an orderly work is appreciated and without a doubt the understanding of some concepts of quantum physics that support quantum cryptography such as the no-cloning theorem and the principle of superposition and interweaving is a task that has its merits, in addition, the use of software engineering in the construction of the application is appreciated, which is a very positive aspect, since generally when software creation is involved in areas of frontier knowledge, code-and-fix is used, with all the disadvantages that this entails. I believe that this manuscript should be directed to the area of cryptography and security, in my specialty, which is computing in distributed environments, I do not see significant relevance and contribution of the manuscript, using RMI in my opinion is not a contribution per se, since RMI is easy to use if JAVA is handled, however, it is not interoperable since ue does not support other programming languages, in addition, the RMI-based systems as they grow have a performance problem, the more they grow the slower they become, on the other hand, according to some purists a client / server system is not a distributed system According to others, the client/server case is the most basic case of distributed computing. In short, speaking strictly from the area of distributed computing, I do not see relevance in this area of this manuscript. However, it seems to me that in another area the paper could be pertinent, since it is an orderly, clear and well-written work. I am not an expert in the area of cryptography, but a few years ago I once heard an Englishman talk about quantum cryptography in a seminar and he mentioned a large number of simulators and applications, he even said that he had applications that already used quantum cryptography among several kilometers through fiber optics, so I think it is best to evaluate this manuscript in that area and not in the area of grid/distributed systems, because in this area the paper, in my opinion, does not have original aspects, since it uses trivial aspects of client/server principles. As I have said before, the paper has more issues of quantum physics and cryptography than distributed computing, for which abstracting myself from the area that concerns me, I see the use of a distributed environment technology used as a client/server, not interoperable and with scalability restrictions. A positive aspect in the paper is that the use of software engineering is appreciated. Regarding the area of grid computing and distributed systems, the manuscript does not contain relevant aspects, it uses RMI to implement a client/server system, however, RMI is easy to use and as a well-known paradigm in computing, performance is opposed to ease of use, RMI does not escape that, because it is easy to use, but it does not have scalability. The document is well presented, perhaps table 2 and table 3 would be better merged using rows as computer and in the columns the details of the network, especially if there is more than a client/server scheme, for example, a network distribution ring. quantum keys, with more than 2 computers involved. I think being introduced to the crypto and security area would be more pertinent.",

There is no evidence of how they reach the conclusions generated, what are they based on to say that it is better or not, that it has fewer errors or not? It is an interesting proposal that can be applied in real cases of requirements engineering processes. Currently it contributes to reduce the crisis associated with this phase of development of software products. The organization of the document can be improved considerably. I consider that a large part of the article is dedicated to expressing the associated conceptual framework, and less to the application of the technique in the case study and the analysis of results, sections in which the proposal presented can be supported more.

The authors of this article do not provide support in relation to the validity of this aspect. The article begins by stating that the proposal is to improve the elicitation of requirements, however, then it follows that what is improved is the generation of the SRS. The elicitation and the generation of the requirements document are different aspects. In the case of experimentation that is presents, it is not seen anywhere that problems are solved neither in the eduction, nor in the generation of the SRS, they are rather problems of the implementation mentation. The errors detected are basic aspects that any programmer with a minimum of experience knows how to solve, without the need for the SRS to specify the type of minimum validations that must be carried out as part of the system tests. The proposal lacks practical guidelines to help in its application. How should these POKA-YOKE reviews be carried out? What aspects should you pay attention to?

Per construction machine learning techniques can not classify such outliers.\" This sentence should be further explained. As Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman say in The Elements of Statistical Learning (see Chapter 7): \"it is too difficult to give a general rule on how much training data is enough; among other things, this depends on the signal-to-noise ratio of the underlying function, and the complexity of the models being fit to the data. \" So, by just saying that the number of training samples is small you do not provide enough information to decide whether machine learning techniques are adequate or not to solve a problem.

SAVE performs a static check of rules associated with permitted and prohibited dependencies between elements of the design and the code, and allows to deliver a report on consistency between both levels regarding these rules. In general, the tool seems quite powerful for two reasons: the use of simple rules and the inclusion of pre-defined rule sets for widely used design patterns. This, in my opinion, is the most important difference with other similar frameworks. The wording is, in some places, unobjective. In particular, I would suggest avoiding excessive use of adjectives for which no supporting evidence is provided. For example, in several places I noticed the use of \"powerful tool\", \"intuitive tool\" or similar (not only referring to SAVE, but to other works.) In all these cases, an e clairvoyance that supports the use of these adjectives. Another detail that requires fixing is the title that appears in the PDF file: \"Prediction of behavior dynamics...\", which does not match the title of the paper. The authors probably used a template from a previous paper with that title.",

The paper provides useful information about the problem in particular, as well as a reasonable categorization of different aspects in this problem. It is a good starting point for an investigation in this line. Although the information provided in the paper is highly relevant for an investigation on this topic, it is insufficient to accept it as a complete and self-contained work. The reason is that the paper focuses on identifying problems and proposing an artifact (the template) that should solve these problems. However, it does not present evidence why this template is a good alternative to solve these problems. For this, the elements mentioned in the future work are required, specifically the specification form al and the automatic tool to create templates and map them to AOP. My suggestion is to wait until these elements are ready to complete this paper and send it to a new conference.",

The article proposes a requirements planning model, supported by an automatic tool. The prototype that they propose is interesting nt and relevant. I think that the model and method that they propose associated with it, which is actually the real contribution of the authors, can be better organized. I consider that from the technical point of view it would be important that the analysis of the results that they propose with the case study of the bank, be done through an interpretation or quantitative comparison, which really shows that with this automatic planning the quality is really being improved. of the process and/or at least the estimation and actual execution of development times will be shorter, a scenario that, according to background information, has already been justified in its direct relationship with quality. It is an interesting proposal that can be applied in real cases of requirements engineering management processes. Currently, it would contribute to the reduction of time associated with this phase of software product development, and consequently with the quality of the process. Bearing in mind that Requirements Engineering has so many causes and problematic actions, which generate software crises and therefore an affectation in quality management, it remains an open question whether a contribution towards the 'planning' of the requirement really achieves a considerable effect, with respect to other causes or crucial points such as 'prioritization of requirements', validation and/or its traceability as such. The organization of the document can be improved in the following aspects: - Some of the figures that are included are not necessary, since they really do not provide anything additional to what is described in the text, and visually they do not say much. - In the 'APARD Design' section they mention many technical aspects characteristic of reference software factories, which do not give more weight to the intention of the article, nor are they giving really influential data for the application. - The quality of the figures can be optimized (mainly those that show the internal components of the algorithm and the actions of use of the system -profiles, since they are the ones that show the greatest contribution). - There are several drafting errors that should be reviewed (for example: the use of 'on the basis of' should be changed to 'based on'; 'is used', to 'is used'.. )",

Under this scheme, a low-cost system is developed, with the advantages and limitations of the proposal - I believe that the proposed system is based on an interesting premise which is its low cost Commercial systems for this type of development can be, in most cases, very expensive, depending on the type of elements used. - Despite the simplicity of the proposed architecture, I think the system can be improved. For now, I think there is still a way to go (according to what I read in the paper) in terms of its use beyond the laboratory. That is why ORIGINALITY is rated 4 (good) - One of the first weaknesses found in the publication is its introduction. This sin, in my opinion, of two problems: The first pr The problem is that its content is too general, in its entirety it talks about what computer vision is, in general, but interesting aspects such as the state of the art in this matter and a relevant bibliography are not detailed. It only says in general terms: \"In works related to this topic, it is generally the object that moves in millimeter form...\". From this I have doubts such as: Are there other ways to reconstruct surfaces? Are there similar works? How is this technique different from others? What is the contribution of your work? Why not use stereo vision (perhaps the costs are similar)? The second problem found is a consequence of the first, since when trying to explain what computer vision is, it has been too long (a little more than three columns), and too general. Perhaps if attention had been focused on the state of the art, this would not be seen as a problem. - On the technical side, I see that your approach can work in a very controlled environment, where there are no big changes in lighting and the surface of the scanned objects have colors that are not very similar to the background and/or laser beam used. Background subtraction for controlled environments may work but outdoors I doubt your system will be as stable. I think the text could have listed the different methods used for segmentation. On page 4 it is referred to but not deepened (\"Different methods were tried for segmentation, of which the image subtraction method was selected...\"). Perhaps it would be good to take advantage of some color space (RBG, YUV, etc.) and use the Mahalanobis distance (get a sample of a laser beam or several) to get a better segmentation of the laser light. - About the presentation, I have found some errors that it would be good to improve: - Figure 2 and figure 3 have the same title, I think there is an error with the title of figure 3. - Figure 2 has some errors and that can lead to mistake \"Light projector\", the \"of\" is underlined. And \"b\" can be confusing since it appears with an underscore. - Some details: - Page 5: \"The above generates them...\" - Page 6: \"which you get better...\" - The laser word appears without a tilde on some occasions.

The description of the 'trends' and 'initiatives' would give greater value to the article than examples like the one included in this last section where they show the representation of a message in different syntaxes. It is relevant to the Chilean context, as they present an interesting proposal for the different actors (government, developers, companies) to take into account to promote this area of work. The organization of the document can be improved in the aspects named in 'technical quality', as well as aspects that show a consequence and coherence between the title, abstract and development of the article. Likewise, there are spelling and writing errors that, if avoided, can add value to the presentation of the article.",

                    "text": "This paper presents important problems in its formulation. The papers of practical experiences must deliver something more than a simple description of the developed system: they must clearly indicate what new knowledge, technique or solution was obtained from said experience. Consequently, a A paper of this nature should include, at least, the following essential elements: - An introduction that clearly explains the purpose of the work: (a) the problem that was solved directly or indirectly with practical experience, (b) why the problem is important and non-trivial and (c) why this experience provided new information within that context (not obtained with similar experiences) - Theoretical framework - The description of the system: it should not be a mere enumeration of its components and functionalities, but clearly indicate those elements that, during their development, provided relevant information to the problem of the study - Conclusions: they must be r aligned with the elements of the introduction and must be supported by the evidence provided in the description of the system. Analyzing the paper from this perspective, we find important problems: First, the introduction is not clear regarding the purpose of the work and. The only part where the objectives are mentioned is in the 5th paragraph, where it is indicated that the case study is \"to empirically demonstrate the development costs\" associated with the technologies shown in the paper. This, along with \"highlighting the main features and potential strengths of CakePHP and MVC..\" seem to be the core elements of the paper. Second, the system description is not very different from a system manual; essential evidence is missing to support the elements of the introduction: associated development costs (time, people, resources) that are supposed to be lower than with another methodology. Although the sections describing CakePHP and MVC have information relevant to the problem, they do not add value to the work if they are not supported by evidence obtained directly from development experience with this technology. Above all, I missed a comparison with some other similar experience, clearly indicating what improvements CakePHP/MVC introduces to development. Finally, the conclusions of the paper are not aligned with the elements indicated in the introduction; some of them deliver information out of context (findings #5 and #6) or are irrelevant (finding #2); others lack supporting evidence (conclusion #1) or are not explicit in associating the evidence with the conclusion (conclusions #3 and #4). Apart from the previous observations, the paper also requires improvements in the presentation of the information. For example, the value that the SQL code in figures 10 and 11 deliver to the paper is not explicit. Figures 12-15 are not adequately described. A person who does not understand command line work well may end up totally disoriented and will not understand the arguments put forward. For all these reasons, the paper is not in a position to be accepted for publication.",

"text": "The article narrates the experience of the development of a robotic solution for the industrial problem of repairing electric motors. In particular, the problem of performing precision welding of electric motors by means of a robotic arm. The article presents practical aspects of the development of the solution, complemented with illustrations that help to understand the problem and the solution development process, understanding that it is an experience of technology transfer to the industry of specialized services that support the main regional economic activity (mining). , the following shortcomings were found: Aspects of form: 1. Non-technical terms are recurrently used, which confuse and do not provide objective background, in addition to writing and spelling errors, for example: children's errors --> it simply should be \" failures\" optimal results --> if \"optimal\" is used, evidence must be provided to support that it is the best best solution and there is no other better. quite high failure rate --> it is preferable to indicate that the estimated failure rate is 55% (5/9). \"rather high\" is ambiguous. solder --> solder? as required --> as required as General Electric, with very good results --> as General Electric, with good results. 2. always use third person. this was given to us --> this was given what we obtained is the following --> what was obtained was the following 3. It is not relevant to mention certain companies from which certain studies were purchased or commissioned: MOTORFIL, INDURA 4. It is assumed that the reader knows the terms and is able to identify parts such as coils and commutators from the figures. This should not be assumed, and should be explained clearly and simply, and its position illustrated in the figures where electric motors are shown. Names such as Innova Chile and their role in the project should be explained at the bottom of the page. 5. Figure 6 is relevant in the explanation. Unfortunately it is poorly readable and this needs to be fixed. 6. use global reachable terms rather than local. for example, cost close to a million pesos (Chilean?) --> cost equivalent to US$2,000 approx. 7. Graph 1 (must be Figure 4): standardize font sizes and indicate the variable on the X axis. Background aspects: 1. a background section is missing that allows later understanding of terms that are used later without having previously defined/explained them . In this sense, there is a paragraph that explains that it is a robot, but it appears in the Robotization of the Welding Process section, so it is misplaced. It must be before along with the other elements of the background. 2. When explaining how the robot was programmed, a drawing or figure is missing to support the explanation (reference plane, user plane, tool plane, etc.). The same is valid for the explanation of why an optical sensor was added (add an illustrative drawing or figure). 3. Statements are made that are not supported by references to studies or documents. On the contrary, the references are not cited within the body of the article. 4. Review the English version of the abstract. There are several writing and grammar errors. 5. There is no detailed technical information on how the robot programming steps were carried out, for example. There are only general descriptions.",

The document has a relatively good structure, comparisons are made and there are some interesting graphics. The document has some shortcomings that make it confusing, for example, page 7 is a complete mess, Figure 7 is not well explained, the tables are treated as figures, there is a difference between what an image and a graph represent, for which they should be treated independently. There is a text that explains Figure 6, which by the way is a table, that text is not part of the body of the paper, is it? It is very difficult to read that page. I am not an expert in the SIFT algorithm, so when reading the paper it is not clear to me if they used the SiftGPU code created by Changchang Wu or took it as a base and applied some modifications to it. On the other hand, it would have been interesting to know why the implementation in CUDA, the implementation in multicore and the serial could give different results, if after all the three approaches are the SIFT algorithm. I have been programming parallel applications for more than 12 years and for the same algorithm I have never observed different results, if after all the algorithm is the same, now, when variants are introduced to the original algorithm in order to force parallelism, have different results, but it is no longer the original algorithm. Reading other papers on the subject, I do not find so much originality, the document does not help much to draw conclusions either. The paper has data from runs and compares different approaches, but I still have a big question as to why the same algorithm with a sequential approach and a parallel one with GPU can yield different results. GPU is an issue that has its thanks, especially for the money savings that its use implies in the long term, so it could be good to spread this work to spread this technology. The document is messy, it is necessary to differentiate what is a figure, a graph and a table, besides page 7 is very difficult to read and the explanation of the data tables is confused with the body of the paper.",

General comments: a) Concerning the proposed approach: The segmentation method introduced only considers local color/gray value information. Perhaps introducing other features related to the membrane's local (eg the membrane has symmetry properties that can be exploited) or global (eg continuity, approximately circular shape) properties may improve the segmentation results.Feature selection is also a key component to improve performance.Use a feature selection procedure. b) Concerning the experimentation: You should describe the experiments with sufficient detail so others can replicate them: a) Make your data publicly available b) Explain how you have selected the classifier's parameters (parameter selection in an SVM is critical and may improve notably the performance). You should join Figs 10 and 9 in a single plot so we can better see the differences. You only provide qualitative segmentation results (Figs. 12, 14, 15), but quantitative results are also very important. Especially when it comes to comparisons. You should quantitatively compare your algorithm with other competing works in the literature. c) Concerning paper organization: The paper is well written and clearly introduces the problem, describes the relevant literature and presents the solution. I have a few comments concerning the paper organization: a) Problem statement and literature review (intro and theoretical framework sections) are in my opinion a bit long, compared to other important sections, e.g. feature extraction and experimentation which are just one paragraph each. b) Although English is in general correct, there are some small mistakes that could be solved by having it read by a professional. c) There are two \"proposed method\" sections Well written paper.

The paper describes quite well the practical problem it deals with (cancer cells segmentation on images) and it is generally well written.- The paper approach described in the paper seems a first try on the problem and follows others in a quite similar (but new) problem. approach is not good enough.- The features used for classification lacks of frequency information around each pixel (although it used the first derivative with sobel).Most texture descriptors in the literature use frequency information from gabor wavelets, fourier coefficients, DCT, etc. Why not use this kind of information? Why you have chosen this 7 features and not other ones? The paper lacks of experimental evaluation on different features sets.",

                    "text": "The article deals with the construction of image retrieval systems based on the content (of the images), CBIR. The CBIR problem is introduced and some algorithms are presented that allow to speed up searches for nearest neighbors to a input vector (corresponding to an image) in the feature space chosen to represent the images Color, frequency response, and global features are used for each of the local frames into which an input image is divided In this way, information of different types is introduced into the CBIR system to represent the images - The article does not clearly delimit its contributions It seems that something is contributed in terms of the space of characteristics in which the images are represented and it also seems that it contributes something on the algorithms and data structures needed to speed up searches in metric spaces - In general the article uses little space in explaining the proposed approach to CBIR (two references to master's theses are given). Experimental results are presented in the conclusions, when clearly they should go in a previous section with the experiments. - Regarding the visual characteristics used to represent an image: Experiments are lacking that allow establishing what each of the characteristics proposed to use contributes. That is, I think it is important to answer the question: Why are you here and not others? and also to the question: Is any of them redundant and could it be stopped being used? Although it is true that a feature selection procedure is used, an experiment establishing the effect of the selection is missing. How much is gained in success rate over the use of the complete vector? It appears that the feature space after selection has dimension 3078 (section 2.4). Is that right or have the 3078 features been "manually" extracted? - The CBIR systems comparison experiment (section 2.3) is not understood. What is done with the 100 images common to databases? Is the same query made in all systems and is precision and recall measured using only the 100 common images when they appear or not in the system's response? That is not explained at all in the article. - When data such as sensitivity and specificity are given in the conclusions, it must be said on which data set it has been tested. It is possible to do a test on some data and obtain a completely different result on others. Therefore sensitivity and specificity without reference to the data from which it has been obtained are meaningless. - It seems to this reviewer that an article on CBIR should not overlook developments in Computer Vision based on (already classic) local features such as: Sivic, J. and Zisserman, A. Video Google: A Text Retrieval Approach to Object Matching in Videos Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (2003) D. Nistér and H. Stewénius, Scalable recognition with a vocabulary tree Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (2006) - Some of the references, such as the [10,11,13], are incomplete.

An example system running on a URL? - The system working on the URL that the authors refer to gives execution errors when trying to test with images extracted from google images.",

                    "text": "The publication aims to show the benefits of metric structures for image retrieval. This work is the continuation of several works already presented, such as [1] \"Parallel metric structures in image retrieval of images\", Peña-Jaramillo, E. (Referenced in the paper) [2] \"Definition of an Image retriever based on Contents on Metric Spaces\", Eduardo Peña-Jaramillo, et al. (Not referenced). [3] \"Parallel Metric Structures in the Retrieval of Images on the Web\", Eduardo Peña-Jaramillo, et al. (Not referenced) About reference number [1] it has not been possible to obtain an electronic copy, and since the aforementioned publications [2] and [3], it can be said that there is a new contribution in the experiments carried out on GNAT and Spaghetti structures, it should be explained in the publication that the work is not original from the author's point of view, and that its extension is based on the works [1], [2], [3] or another that is directly related to the work presented. - The text is well structured and it is easy to understand what you want to expose. - Good presentation, no serious problems. Only improve the figures of the graphs, especially the accents, in matlab you can add text in latex to avoid this type of problem. The word \"more\" appears a couple of times without a tilde. - In the \"Introduction\" section, although the work is presented in a general way, I think it would be important to point out the state of the art in these matters. Are there related works? Are there important references? What is the contribution of the work to the state of the art?, etc. A more exhaustive bibliographic review is lacking. - In the \"Feature Extraction\" section I have found some details such as: - It has been difficult for me to find a definition of the layout technique since there is only one reference [1], so I suspect that features have been considered obtained from each sub-image as a signal which are mixed to obtain the vector that represents the total image, as it says in the text: \"The union of all the extracted characteristics gives us as a result...\", where it is not clear what type of \"join\" is performed. - The same thing also happens when the Fisher discriminant is referenced, again reference is made to [1]. A more relevant source should be added for this point. - The type of database used is not explained in detail. Is it public or private domain? What kind of images or groups of images it contains. How many are there per class? Are there repeated images? Quality of the images. The idea is to have a frame of reference so that anyone who wants to compare their algorithms with theirs can do so on equal terms. - From the images shown in figure 2, I can deduce that the database (I hope I am wrong) has repeated images, which can produce a bias when calculating the values of precision, sensitivity and specificity of the retrieved images. I believe that the ideal database to be able to correctly measure the quality of the recovery should have different images even if they have the same appearance, but never the same. Since when retrieving a set of images over a query image, if they are repeated, the number of true positives will be proportional to the repeated ones, which will result in a bias on the calculation of the metrics. Recommendations - In the text it is mentioned (conclusions section) that the solutions are not entirely satisfactory. I think there are currently projects like http://similar-images.googlelabs.com/, http://www.like.com/, http://www.tineye.com/, among others; that show great progress in this field and would be good to be reviewed. - On the other hand, regarding the set of features used, I recommend reviewing other types of features that have been shown to be invariant to scale and rotation.

"text": "The article promises to present a method to measure the quality of software development in SCRUM. I consider the proposal interesting and relevant, however the work has weaknesses in its construction. The promise of the title is diluted in the abstract and the introduction, with the "introduction" of SPEM as a tool. Then, in the body of the article, the link between SPEM and the proposed quality measurement method is not clear. The case study on which they are basing their work is not clear either. modeling in SPEM is about SCRUM theoretically in the case study. The evaluation of the method does not seem to measure the quality of the software, but rather the criteria of those involved with respect to adherence to the modeled process. And in any case, it always measures documents intermediate of the process and no defects or first attributes of the quality of the software produced Minor comments: - Review the construction of the references - The SCRUM modeling does not include the retrospective meeting. If you are modeling a particular SCRUM implementation, make it clear in the body of the paper. Otherwise it is a major modeling error. - Why do you use a traditional process to model an agile process? Couldn't one of the latter have been used? - On the first sheet, at the end of the first column, change the font.",

To exemplify the steps, the author used a mobile robot called AMADEUS (similar to cleaning robots marketed in Japan [1 ]). To apply the concepts of fuzzy logic, the Mamdani module was used. General Evaluation. The topic is extremely interesting and very recurrent lately. Devices that use fuzzy logic to operate is a very interesting and innovative bridge between Artificial Intelligence and \"pervasive computing \". However, this work has at least one important weakness that should be resolved: 1) In the work it does not show why it is really important to use fuzzy logic. An application example is strongly recommended for the work. How would using fuzzy logic help? 2) At work it is not very clear to me if the use of fuzzy logic in mobile devices is something new in this area, if it is not something new, perhaps the work could become only a repetition of another work. If it's something new, please mention it. Minor Comments: - In the conclusions, the phrase \"it was demonstrated\" is mentioned; it is suggested to change to \"showed\". - Pay attention to the use of punctuations (eg \"...\", \".\") and the use of capital letters. - At the end of the introduction, it is suggested to mention the structure of the document.

                    "text": "The article presents a case study of the application of a template to measure quality according to the ISO 9126 standard. Although it is true that it fits within the scope of the event and its proposal may be of interest to software engineers who wish to have some practical instrument to apply in their quality systems, the work has serious deficiencies that must be improved to be published. The technical presentation of the document has shortcomings that do not meet the standards established for writing the article. In particular, we can mention some : - Formatting is not uniform as can be seen in the abstract which has different length settings. There are also differences in spacing after each paragraph. Sometimes it exists and sometimes it doesn't. Bullets have different indentations. Bibliographical references have different indentations. - The most serious is the spelling and writing. The document requires a thorough editing revision. In only the first two paragraphs of the introduction I have found more than 5 faults. Regarding its structure, I think it should be reorganized to improve its presentation. I think the objectives should go inside the introduction. The presentation of the ISO criteria should be summarized in a descriptive table. It's annoyingly long and I think it can be referenced for details. On the other hand, I think it should be clarified if the template is pre-existing or is a proposal of the work, in which case it should be highlighted since it would be the main contribution of the article. Your presentation is unfortunate. I think it should be summarized in a table and clearly state what can be answered. Most are not even presented as questions. I insist that if the template is the contribution it should be made easier for other engineers to use. Your presentation does not help this. (eg the first, \"When interacting with the system, please note how predictable it is\": what do I say?) The instrument should be self-contained so that it clearly contains guidance for its application. Furthermore, it doesn't provide clarity on how I combine query responses to get a quality metric. I think there is too much work left for the reader. The results are not presented in a readable way. I think a table would help. It even mentions several times the tabulation of the results but this does not appear. As it is a case study, I would like to see in that table the answers that were obtained and how the percentages that measure quality were calculated.",

The article is an approximation for the generation of a future methodological guide focused on implementing improvements in maturity in BI for an organization. Therefore, it is an initial investigation, but the comparison made is interesting. For the quantitative comparison, 5 of the 6 methodologies were selected. Later, when the qualitative analysis was carried out, 6 methodologies were used and not 5 , including the one already discarded. On page 2 it says \"The objective of this research is to identify ...\". The objective is not to \"identify\" but to \"make a comparison to select ...\". Section IV talks about a systematic review, but does not put any reference associated with that work previously carried out. How did you select the models and from where? Other observations and/or doubts: - La Refere ncia 18 is not cited in the text. - There are 4 references associated with maturity models ([3], [11], [15], [17]). None make a comparison? - Revise the English in Keywords - Change \"Palabras Claves\" to \"Palabras Claves\" - On page 2, change \"In section V details\" by \"In section V details\" or by \ "Section V details\". - The same problem occurs on page 3 with \"Figure 3 is shown\", \"Table 2 is described\", \"Figure 6 is shown\", \"It is observed in Table 11 is posted \". - You must correct \"stuck\" words. For example, change \"aparse\", \"dedetail\", etc. - Does not indicate the meaning of each of the elements of equation 3. - Before Table 7, there is text only in one column. - On page 8, Table 9, change \"to integrate\" to \"to integrate\". - Correct misspelled words: \"escazas\", \"se precia\". - On page 9 he talks about \"thesis research\" and not an article. - In Reference [7] it is written \"Jour-nal\", In Reference [13] a number appears after the last name of the authors (example: \"Tan1\", \"Sin1\", \"Yeoh2\" - In Reference [18] appears \"2010b\"",

To do this, the article begins by describing the theory of the Biological Immune System of vertebrates, which defines, in addition to explaining its operation. then describes the biological models as a theoretical review of the subject. Finally describes the characteristics of artificial immune systems and details the different fields of application. General Evaluation. The subject of the article is extremely interesting, and rarely seen (at least by me) As the article posits, it makes a bibliographic review of the theory and provides a description of the variety of applications that this field of study has. It manages to summarize these concepts that can effectively serve as a frame of reference within literature. However, the article has some weaknesses: 1) The great weakness of the article is its structure The article does not follow the format or standard of work of a scientific article. Here I present some examples. a) The introduction does not present the structure that the article follows, nor a general idea of what the authors want to achieve. b) There is no outline of the ideas of each section, nor an introduction per section. This means that there is no clear proposal by the authors and what they try to propose is only seen on the last page. 2) Another weakness is that it does not establish any way to evaluate and compare the different applications of the subject in order to connect them with the theory and present a contribution of the article. For this reason, it does not comply with what is established in its abstract: \" . . . to establish guidelines in the application of these techniques in the different areas of knowledge.\" 3) Another problem is that it does not establish any type of conclusion or of the implications of the article, which ends with the description of an application in combinatorial optimization. Other comments. Minor drafting problems: a) \"...and molecules belonging to external (not self) antigens, which ultimately constitute a threat to the organism...\" It is understood that a word is missing after “ last”. b) \"describe basic features of an immune response\" This phrase does not establish a definition. c) \"innate immune cells specialized dendritic cells\" Words are missing here too.",

The objective of the prototype may be experimentation with development technologies available for RA, the development of functional software to be put into production or both. In the central section of the article (proposed solution) there are multiple sections where concepts are mixed: selection of tools, application architecture design, list of functionalities (which should be reviewed to be an extension of the requirements of Section III) . I suggest separating and selecting only one of these aspects to deal in greater depth. For example, the selection and justification of tools is scattered at various points of the article.

My main repairs are: Figure 7 presents graphics with a window of 10 minutes, being that the proposal indicates 5 minutes - in my opinion, the system does not represent a data mining process because there is no new accourable knowledge, but rather It is a classification system. There may be new knowledge, but the document does not reflect as the system carried out helped to obtain new knowledge of the attacks. - There is little explanation and lack of experimentation to argue and justify the use of DBSCAN on another type of clustering or even instead of a classifier. - It is known that an attack SYN-FLOOD produces a high number of connections at a given time, so it is not clear if it is necessary such a sophisticated system to detect this phenomenon, this could be clarified if comparison was included with other approaches .",

Basically, the model considers three properties to evaluate its quality: social skill, autonomy and pro-activity. To evaluate these properties, the author breaks down these properties into several measurable sub-properties. The author evaluates this model through a study case: a banking system. General Comments: In a manner, the structure of the document has the necessary aspects to be considered a scientific article. The contribution of the article seemed to be relevant. That said, this work lacks some points that (for me) is important to address: * The author mentions that there is no model to evaluate the quality of agent software, and he proposes one. The proposal of Him is an adaptation of ISO / IEC, however, the author does not justify why it is appropriate. * With respect to the previous point, paragraph 1 of the introduction says that there is no model that measures the quality of the software. Then, paragraph 2 mentions that there are some jobs about this. The author should clarify the contribution of him. * The author mentions that software was developed for this work, however, this work appears as another more publication (and from another author). If it is the aforementioned software is not part of the contributions of the work, please eliminate these phrases. Other comments: * In the section of the study case it is not so easy to understand it. For example, Figures 2, 5 and 7 is not understood to refer to its acronyms (eg AMS). I suppose they correspond to the sub-properties. * It is recommended to exchange section 3 by section 2. That is, first explain that it is an agent and then talk about related work. * I do not have me clear if it is \ "Software Agent \" or \ "Software Agent \". Even the author also confuses this terminology (first sentence of section 4).",

Subsequent ideas are interesting and, at least, generate a break with respect to classic ideas of objects orientation. I quote the idea of proposed system: \ "A system is a set of linked and inter-acting classes according to the same method, which is not particular to each class but emerging from all of them \". Other ideas associate transaction with reference set, macros, types, instances, ... what in global terms constitute a new body of ideas.

                    "text": "RESUME. This work describes three of teaching activities in an elective course at the University of La Serena. Develop interpreters using the Antlr tool on Android is the main connection of these activities. The first activity implements a parser / interpreting for a calculator. The second activity incorporates the ability to order lists in the interpreter. The last activity incorporates the voice recognition service using a Google bookstore. According to work, the result of these activities allowed students to better understand the concepts of formal languages. GENERAL EVALUATION: The work describes very clearly how activities were carried out in the elective course. However, from my point of view, the work presents two great weaknesses: 1) The main motivation of work is that the use of Antlr tools are useful for formal languages courses. However, a sample of why this statement is true, they are only detailed as implementing the software of the activities. It is strongly advisable to give real signs (eg justifications, experiments, etc) of why these tools help the teaching of these topics. 2) This point is the cause of the previous point. Not a motivation or problem that clearly shows the need to use these tools for a language course. If the authors manage to find a clear and measurable motivation, point 1) can be resolved. Finally, the work fails to convince with its conclusion. Minor comments: 1) The work exceeds the maximum number required of pages (9 (> 8) pages). 2) In the conclusion, it is stated that with the use of Antlr on Android and the knowledge of formal languages, SIRI (Apple) & Google NOW can be equated. In my opinion, that affirmation is not true, because to resolve the activities use Google APIs, meaning that without Google's products, these activities can not be carried out. In summary, antlr and the knowledge of formal languages are not enough to build Google NOW. 3) It would be nice to use the DSLS canonic references instead of those used at work: @article {vandeursen: 2000: DLA: 352029.352035, Author = {van Deursen, Arie and Klint, Paul and Visser, Joost}, title = { Domain-Specific Languages: AN ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY}, Journal = {Sigplan not.}, ISSUE_DATE = {June 2000}, Volume = {35}, Number = {2000}, ISSN = { 0362-1340}, pages = {26--36}, numparages = {11}, url = {http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/352029.352035}, DOI = {10.1145 / 352029.352035}, acmid = {352035 }, Publisher = {ACM}, Address = {New York, NY, USA},} @Article {Mernik: 2005: DDL: 1118890.1118892, Author = {Mernik, Marjan and Heering, Jan and Sloane, Anthony M.}, Title = {When and How to Develop Domain-Specific Languages}, Journal = {ACM Comput.

The document is well structured and its reading is easy. Few wording errors are observed. In addition, its format is the demanded by Congress. In relation to the subject of the article, being an application of BPMN, it is not novel. From the case, I think it was possible to make a greater contribution, perhaps proposing a methodology to address the review of business processes, considering that the internal and external actors of the company, generally prioritize the optimization of their productive processes more than the review Of other processes. Finally and not least, the emphasis of the article is the review (audit) of the process with BPMN, moving away from the themes of Congress. Special emphasis could be given applications associated with Congress, such as BPMN requirements analysis, SOA implementation from BPMN, process monitoring with BAM and BPMN, etc. In some figures, although contractors are mentioned as an external entity, a "lane" is not used to represent them and thus observe the interaction with the process under review. The future raised work is related to the results obtained from the improvements implemented from the analysis carried out in this work. I believe that rather to follow the improvements implemented it is convenient to follow up on how the revision of a processes is addressed in an environment that does not prioritize this type of task or is complex to perform them.",

A small and simple set of BPMN elements was used to model the business process. This experience is valid, but it is an ad hoc solution for the selected business process. The solution would have greater assessment if a small model had been presented that could be validated and that could solve a given set of business processes associated with mining. Some observations and / or minor comments: - Does not meet the requirement to present the articles as anonymous of authors and institution. - In summary, change "control your processes" for "control of your processes". - In Introduction, change "BPMNS benefits" for "BPMN benefits". - On page 3 and others, use the words "Figure" and "Figure" in the text. - on page 5, Change "Figure 2 has been included" by "in Figure 2 have been included." - The reference to some figures 3 and 4 (shown on page 6) are only mentioned at the bottom of page 7.

It would be better to reference a scientific article methodology and that would give more \ "weight \" to the article. When talking about HL7 / CDA, a reference should be indicated for more information. There is no clear use of pgfoundry that is an extension of PostgreSQL, was it used with MySQL?. More use of the use of pgfoundry should have been taken. In the design of the study case in Figure 5 there are serious errors in the relationships between the Tables consultation and patient, between the Tables Medication_Syntoma and Medicament. It is not indicated in the article that the duration attribute is a period type, that is important. In the consultation examples there is an error in the SGBDT query, Figure 7, since the Period Attribute is indicated and the attribute is duration.

Statistical methods (analysis of variance) are applied correctly, although an analysis of normality in the distribution could be included. One of the weak points of the work is that a deeper discussion of the results is needed. Beyond indicating that one of the architectures has better performance, the reasons should be discussed and new conjectures made. The generalization of the results and the discussion of threats to validity should be part of the discussion. For example: What kind of obstacles does each algorithm work on? What is the programming effort of each of the architectures? What are the robot's high-level navigation goals (deliberative behavior)?",

What are the limits between the perception of professional and personal success? Is it possible to carry out a study of the perception of professional success only considering the BTM model and leaving out technological skills? Does the study apply to all IT professionals or only to those who manage technology projects as CIOs? The main weakness of the research is that it is identified as an experimental method, when in reality the survey does not have the degree of control over the object of study to be classified in this way. There is also talk of a causality study, but the survey would only allow a co-relationship study. About the survey it is explained which are the evaluated factors and the Likert scale. However, there are no examples of specific questions and an explanation of how they will be answered by the subjects. For example: Is it feasible for a person to evaluate your commitment or leadership? Although the relationship is being evaluated in general terms and not in our own terms, it would be advisable to first validate the model and then carry out the survey itself with a group of experts or managers of IT professionals.",

In my opinion, the article makes an adequate summary for people who do not belong to the area but are familiar with some key concepts described in the paper. It is worth mentioning that it seems to me to be a well-written and planned article, in general, with an easy-to-understand structure. In addition, another criticism I would make is that although the ideas of CMMI and agile development seem well described to me, the same does not happen with respect to adequately justifying their specific application in SMEs. I think the article could be substantially improved. A suggestion that I would make for this would be the presentation of a case that strengthens the central argument of the article, that is, CMMI and agile development are compatible and especially useful for SMEs. In that way, Less emphasis could be given to revision (which seems to me insufficient in that sense) and the practical relevance of the argument would be raised. If so, the article could have an interesting projection. In addition, the inclusion of references should be improved since there are a large number of arguments that deserve to be clarified if they belong to an opinion of the authors or are extracted from existing theory. There are very minor spelling and grammatical errors.",

but rather it seems to be a note about some filtering and segmentation methods. A review of the state of the art, in my opinion, should have a purpose such as identifying the main gaps in the literature or research opportunities. Third, although a literature review is essentially an abstract, it must be systematic. That is, it must have a method that has to be specified. For example, what was the search equation used and what was the time range and selection criteria of the reviewed articles or which were eliminated and why. Finally, although it has nothing to do with the content or the objective of the article, there are obvious formatting problems. For example, the entire conclusion section is centered rather than justified. What's more, there are drafting problems that in some parts make it difficult to understand the text.

Unfortunately, the article has great weaknesses: 1) The scope may not be appropriate for a congress like INFONOR. 2) The results are brief and weakly exemplified, which makes it difficult to understand the use of the model. 3) More examples could be used for ease of reading. 4) The format of the paper has problems.

in such a way that the preliminary results obtained up to the point where the research project is found can be presented, that is, a conceptual review of financial aspects for IT Services, without generating expectations regarding the development of statistics or cost analysis that have not yet been calculated. In order to have a strong emphasis on reviewing concepts, the article is sparsely referenced. It is recommended to improve the concepts and the conceptual base from a comprehensive literature review that allows to base the research and present partial results of the review of concepts. There are marked deficiencies in the drafting of the document. Letters are missing from the abstract and punctuation marks are not clear. In paragraphs like the first of the second column on page 3, it is difficult to understand the idea and that makes it difficult to read the document. In sections defining concepts such as IT Costs (page 3) it is necessary to refer to the conceptual statements (fundamental basis of the article). It is recommended to take into account the terms in English to unify the way of citing terms or concepts. Some cannot be translated, but it is advisable to handle concepts in only one language. In addition, it is advisable to define the objective of the article and focus it on a single purpose. That is, if you want to present the methodology for the design of the research, emphasis should be placed on it. Or, if what you want is to emphasize the calculations established or designed by means of the tool, then focus the article on this objective.

I suggest to be more specific (eg “systematic review for elicitation techniques”?) 2) “systematic mapping” is not explained, only its use is explained. 3) Why is there no talk of meta-analysis?

Finally,The acknowledgments section is in English and suggests that the work is part of a project financed by Conicyt.",

Nor does the author clearly establish the motivation that has led him to develop a new solution for the problem posed. A research objective as such of the article is not defined since it is mentioned that this will be to "expose a commercial information system adaptable to any retail business......" . In general, it is desired to present the built application and it is not specified what is expected from the article, the methodologies to be used and what is innovative in terms of development for the discipline of information systems. One of the main limitations of this article is the state of the art. The review of the literature is almost non-existent in relation to the theories that support the development of the application and the main authors on platform development issues of this nature are not mentioned. No theoretical framework is established in the article in terms of design or implementation of the application. Proposals are not discussed in those terms either, so it is possible to say that there are no theoretical references in terms of analysis, design and implementation. This difficulty means that the evaluation of what has been developed is only based on general opinions about what the concept of information systems is. The research methodology is another important shortcoming of this article. The article moves between the importance of the application to a description of what is possible to do with it without establishing clear and accepted development and implementation methodologies (either for the design of the tool or for the analysis of the results obtained from its use). ). This complicates the evaluation of the work since there are no research questions to answer, nor ways to evaluate if the author's expectations are met or if the results obtained will be valid. The author of the article should present and describe the research designs to be used to allow their validity to be evaluated. Most of the article is in the development item and it defines and details the characteristics of the company in which the study will be developed. It is not clearly specified which parts of the system are acquired commercially and which are developed internally and how the connection with other existing platforms is achieved. Nor are process or data models associated with this construction established. The authors limit themselves to explaining the functionalities of the tool and how it will be used in the company, but it is not possible to know how it was implemented and compare the results that stand out as relevant from the implementation. Although the tool may be very simple from a design and architecture point of view, a description that presents process models using ad-hoc tools and at least a description of the design stage would be expected. The results obtained are generally mentioned as something that was achieved and as percentages of improvements in management and it is not possible to draw valid conclusions about them. The conclusion of the article is weak in terms of the results obtained from the design and implementation of the application and, above all, the contribution of the study to the discipline of information systems. I consider that the article requires major changes and that work should be done on the definition of the objective, the methodology to be used for the analysis and design of the platform. Therefore I suggest in this opportunity its rejection for this conference",

The proposed model is aimed at decoupling the business logic of business rules The problem addressed in the article is adequately supported by the difficulties mentioned in the field of software projects and in the financial world The author could delve a little more into the experiences of project development in other areas and the relevance of business rules in the development of efficient information systems in the company The objective declared by the author            is to propose a methodology that makes it possible to make the operation of information systems in financial entities more flexible, which is generally adequately explained. The literature review is relevant to the issues addressed and the theories and models considered are appropriate to the objective that has been set. The analyzes associated with the concept of business rules and system architecture are related to the topic. The author should specify how the relationship between process modeling and the design and characterization of business rules is established. It is mentioned that they use the decision point tables, but these are not mentioned in detail or visually. The author should better support the choice of “Pipes and Filter” as the architecture model of the system. It would also be important to highlight if there are similar works carried out in other areas (since the author does not mention it) The methodological aspect of the work focuses on describing the process through which the definition of the software architecture is reached to automate the rules of business and the tools that were used in its development. This methodological approach is appropriate and is clearly associated with a case study application. The important contribution in this aspect is the detailed description of the process from the lifting of the rules to the design and development of the proposed application architecture. The author should make a summary table in which this process is represented in summary form. It is clear that the results of this work have the desired validity, since it is based on the use of models and tools already validated in the field of rule-based business platform design. The contribution of the work is important since it systematizes a process that is widely used in the development of information systems that are flexible and adaptable to the changing environment. However, these contributions are not clearly reflected in the conclusions, which is why it is suggested that the authors improve the conclusions, including significant contributions in methodological terms and contributions to the discipline in which the article is framed.

The abstract indicates that the objective of the work is to propose an automation model of business rules that manages to decouple the business logic, however during the document no reference is made to any model.A methodology is presented in the section with its name, but it is not clear how said methodology allows to generate an automation model of business rules. The article lacks a logical sequence of sections that account for the explicit proposal cited in the abstract. In the System Architecture section, the architecture of a system is presented and aspects of the architecture are explained. However, In this section, it is also not possible to identify a model for automating business rules, taking into account that the article lacks hard work to improve the presentation of the same that allows understanding the proposal that is made, I suggest rejecting it. Below I send some observations that can be used to improve the work: Although the methodology used is explained in detail by phases, in none of them is reference made to the results achieved in its implementation in the case of the work that is exposed, that is, applied in an environment of financial entities. In the system architecture section, figure 5 and figure 6 are presented but they are not explained or contextualized within the document. This creates confusion. This section does not identify the application of the methodology set out in the previous section, in relation to the generated architecture. It should be clearly indicated how the architecture was achieved based on the methodology selected and explained in the Methodology section. In the introduction it is clear what is the proposal of the work presented. A paragraph must be structured that includes a definition of the objective of the work and the proposed solution that is made taking into account the title of the work. Some drafting errors must be corrected, such as: - In the abstract... For what purpose is it proposed...? - In the introduction... one of the main challenges of software engineering is not to generate...? - On page 3, the phase A term has a meaning for the business that must be understood and shared, is repeated twice. - On page 4 the word valido has an accent and in the last paragraph the accent is outside the word esta´. - At the end of page 5 the title is divided (widow). - It is suggested to improve the wording of the paragraph... The architectural vulnerability of the software systems has been observed in the provision of the services it provides with respect to the drafts... -The figures are not cited in the text, they are only indicated following figure, which constitutes problems both in form and edition of the article. Figures should be cited in the text, with the corresponding number in the title of the figure. - Figure 3 is not understood. The text is very small and it is not possible to identify the business process model referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph. - The last paragraph on page 6 is not understood and is spoken in the first person. The wording should be corrected. - In the Methodology section, reference is made to a project that has not been described before. It would be convenient to explain what the project referred to is about. In this section, the type of methodology referred to is not clear.

                    "text": "Throughout the article, the role of test automation within software testing and more generally in the assurance framework is exaggerated. A maturity model for software testing necessarily includes more aspects than automation. Automated cases will always coexist with manual cases and evaluations performed by people. As discussed in the article, automation is too general a concept, it can encompass the generation, execution, evaluation (for example: mutation, coverage criteria ) and validation (oracle problem). Although the motivation is clearly expressed in the introduction, references are needed to substantiate the statements made about the role of the test and the impact of automation on it. To say that automation allows performing the faster or cheaper testing is simplistic: this depends on the context The costs of generating automated test cases, the estimation of Information on future software evaluation and test case expiration, along with other factors, must be factored into the cost model to determine the desirability of automating a certain portion of the test. The section dedicated to software testing makes general definitions and walks through the history of testing since the mainframes. For a research article, I suggest making more specific definitions related to the focus of the study (experimental studies on test techniques, automation, test costs, maturity models). It would be appropriate to put the development of the maturity model after presenting the related work. The process to obtain the proposal of a maturity model for testing is not described. The development of the model must be linked to other existing maturity models (for example the Testing Maturity Model), establish connections with the accepted testing literature or standards (for example ISO 29119) and in general with software process models. The search string used is not specified. Not all models found should be classified as 'maturity models'. Some of the included models are clearly more general models, not addressing the problem of test automation. These differences should at least be discussed. The attributes used in table III are not explained, nor how to obtain the maturity level results. What does 'level of published reviews' mean? This concept is ambiguous. The description of this research process should be reinforced as it is key to obtaining the 'adolescent' level result.",

The document shows a series of sections that account for a work carried out in terms of literature review and some approaches to a proposal to restructure a scale of particular maturity levels for the test automation process.However , the work lacks a logical structure that allows determining if its contribution or main objective is in the literature review or in the proposal of new maturity levels for the testing process. It is recommended to make a complete review of the information presented and possibly restructure the document presented. The report of this review was divided into sections, in order to provide suggestions that allow improving the Section -Systematic review It is important that the authors review the fact of using a systematic review method that is not yet published. There have been several published, tested, and recognized methods for software engineering. They should justify the selection of the method proposed by Serna M. identified with the number [16] in the work. It is essential to explain the validation that is done regarding the peer review of the articles, since it is not clear how a peer review of the published articles can be accessed in order to validate them and how a validation process is carried out from of said information, taking into account the number of revisions that would have to be made for each article found (978). Test automation Although, in the work a proposed model is reported to evaluate the maturity of the software test automation process. The model as such is not described. The article is limited to presenting a reference scale associated with the maturity of a human being. Therefore, it is essential that the article indicates several aspects to consider the structuring and definition of a model. Among the most important aspects to consider are: 1. A scientific and formal justification on which the authors of the work are based to propose the maturity model and the selection of the maturity levels of a human being as a point of comparison with a possible maturity level of the test automation process. 2. Formal justification of why not to use the CMMI model and the structure of maturity levels proposed in it to evaluate the test automation process. The foregoing, taking into account that the maturity model defines an appropriate maturity scale to evaluate processes in software engineering. In other words, why is it necessary to rethink those maturity levels for the test automation process and propose a new scale based on the maturity of a human being? 3. At the research level, how are maturity levels characterized in terms of test automation? Although the article characterizes each level indicating the possible characteristics in which the test automation process is, it does not indicate how said characterization was determined, nor is a related formal and scientific justification shown. Related work The work presents a systematic review, under which it is possible to identify work related to the area of study, in this case test automation or maturity levels for test automation. However, the authors present the systematic review separately from the related work section, when it appears that the studies selected as related work should be part of the analysis of the results of the systematic review. In addition, the systematic review allows the identification of research gaps or niches (research opportunities) to determine a work area with a specific problem and, from there, propose a possible solution to said problem. In this case, the article presents the systematic review as an additional work and subsequent to the proposal of maturity levels for the test automation process. Likewise, the authors show the selection of some related works, it is understood that they are related to test automation, notwithstanding the first Michael Grottke, they indicate precisely that it does not focus on the subject to be treated in the work they present but on a Statistical proposal of test automation. Therefore it would not enter as related work. Software Test Automation Development Maturity To compare the test automation process and its maturity levels, the authors present Table 3. It indicates that the first column lists the traditional stages of a test automation process. testing process. It is necessary to indicate under what methodology these stages are selected as traditional or to have a reference as justification for the selection of these and not other stages. In this section there is no clear explanation of the determination of maturity levels at each stage. It is essential to have a description of the research analysis carried out, which results in the definition of the maturity level of each of the stages of the testing process. The table is not a sufficient explanation for the analysis, since it only reports the results. At this point, if what is sought is to propose a new maturity scale for the test process or test automation, the most convenient thing is to validate said proposed scale with a case study. In this work, although the authors show a table where they seem to determine that the maturity level is \"adolescent\", it is not possible to understand in what context the test automation process is being evaluated. At least one case should be contextualized where it is indicated: region, time, type of projects or companies and methodology used to evaluate the test automation process. The foregoing is the basis for justifying that in a given context the test automation process is at X level of maturity (of the proposed scale). Arguing, in addition, the criteria that were taken into account to assign said level of maturity.",

The motivation for why they were selected is not described, nor is the bias that this selection may have in the model --> The use of a Research/Action methodology is described, but the phenomenon that has been studied to consolidate the model is not described --> The theoretical framework sections also seem to be biased, and describes the sources that gave rise to the selection of references Other minor comments: - The translation of the abstract into English should be reviewed - The bibliography of software quality, comes out of textbooks, and can be updated - The scope e towards quality tributes, is both introduced as part of the methodological framework, and exposed as conclusions. It can't be both. By directing the research towards owasp, the construct is oriented towards security attributes, therefore the conclusion: \"In the same sense, it is established that the quality of a system for Internet Banking must consider security as a mandatory point, in addition to the functionality\" It is a result of the design of your research, and cannot be extracted from the work. - Reference 6 and 11 are the same.",

Some models are treated first in a preliminary section and others after the theoretical analysis, I suggest re-organizing the presentation of concepts. In my In my opinion, the concepts of quality model and conceptual model are not equivalent, although they are treated together in the introduction.In the second section several models are presented, but the relationships between them and what is the criterion for having them is not clearly established taken into account in this line of research. There are multiple proposals for software quality models and specific models for the web. On the other hand, the OWASP guidelines are relevant to the security of web applications, they are not a quality model. I suggest exposing the theoretical analysis (which includes basic definitions of quality) before the description and justification of the considered models On the other hand, concepts could be added / attributes / specific quality models in the context of banking systems. In my opinion, devoting so much space to defining the concept of electronic banking, internet banking and then mobile banking is not necessary in the current state of the art and public knowledge of these concepts. I suggest focusing on the research objectives of this particular work. The descriptions of the DESMET methodological framework and the research-action methodology are very brief. It is necessary to establish the objectives of the research beforehand. The conceptual models obtained are the main result of the work. More readable notations should be used (I also suggest putting extended information as an annex to the article or on the web). It should also be explained how these models were validated, so that they are reliable if they are used to define ontologies or used in later works.",

GENERAL EVALUATION: The document does not follow the structure of a scientific article and it does not seem to follow the INFONOR format either. In addition, the work presented seems more like an engineering work than a scientific one. Although this mobile Web application could be interesting, it should be mentioned that it does not offer any URL address where (com )test the presented application. Section 2 should discuss the related work and some concepts, but in the middle of this section, part of the proposal is described. Also, the work defines in almost a column what crime is using extensive citations ( “ … ”). The discussion section of experiments and results does not describe experiments or results (the latter are described but not discussed), only some facets/screens of the application are shown. n. Furthermore, it justifies the use of Android through a very long quote ("..."). MINOR DETAILS: - The abstract in English could be improved, starting by eliminating the first word of the paper. The abstract could be written in Spanish. - The format of the document does not follow the INFONOR standard, especially with the margins, - In some parts of the document, the word “thesis” and not article can be observed. In other parts of the text, you can see the word "presentation". - Figure 1 adds almost nothing to the document. - After each title, you can see “:” which is not necessary. - Section 2 overuses quotes “…” - Section 2.2 talks about types of crime, but in the sub-headings of this section it says “Analysis” - The title of section 2.3 clashes with the text of the column of left - Table 2, which mentions the applications, is not evaluated.",

The problem addressed in the article is adequately supported by the existing needs to provide data to evaluate transparency and public interest. An investigation is carried out applied to the main government web platforms in Chile. The objective is declared by the author and establishes that the state of open data in Chile is presented and a diagnosis of the main sites and tools provided by the state to improve transparency and enhance citizen participation The bibliographic review is relevant to the topic but quite general The model used to measure the quality of data on the web is chosen without justifying through an analysis that establishes its efficiency compared to other models The review of the concept of open data is minimal and is not present in the review carried out as this issue has been addressed in different countries and the results they have obtained. The authors should further delve into the concept of open data at the government level for transparency and the public interest and better support this division in the literature. The methodological aspect of the work focuses on using the 5-star model and describing a general classification based on this model. Although this methodological approach is adequate and is clearly associated with the subject, it does not present propositions to be evaluated (research questions or hypotheses to be tested). The diagnosis is basic and general based on four variables that allow each platform to be classified. The author should also establish a categorization of what the study subjects are (the government of Chile is mentioned but there are only four platforms out of the total number of platforms owned by the government). In this sense, it should refer to transversal central service platforms (since it does not analyze local governments at any time). This work is based on the use of a diagnostic model already validated in the literature , however its application is limited and, in my opinion, it does not allow generalize to the government as a whole. The contribution of the work is important since it presents relevant information in the process of reaching what is open government. However, the generalizability of their results is questionable as it is limited to four variables and four websites.

                    "text": "As for the general aspects, three things: 1) the authors should be consistent with the nomenclature used: mainly requirements vs. requirements: please use only one of the two denominations, but do not mix at will 2) Secondly, small settings vs. small and medium-sized companies. If you go to the definition given by the SEI, you will see that it is not the same, the concept of small setting being broader. In this case I think that the authors are referring to small companies. 3) As a third comment, general, check the punctuation marks, very long sentences. In the abstract, the authors indicate that they are going to offer a work proposal for small environments. I cannot find that proposal of works in the article. Also, it is better not to put references in the abstract. In the introduction, second paragraph, it appears \"since this allows to guarantee FROM ...\" an UNTIL SUCH THING is expected... In the section system review process topic, it is not necessary to make a subsection, it does not make much sense to divide something into a single section. In the systematic review phases grant, they first say there are 3 steps and then they call it phases. Which of the two is it??? The names given to the phases do not coincide with those of the following sections, nor with those of Figure 1. Figure 1 does not contribute anything. In the planning section, words like \"above\" are not very valid in written language. Likewise, in the planning they include paragraphs that justify the reason for the SMEs, this is already out of context here. They also indicate that the objective of the review is to find models, methodologies, proposals or processes related to requirements management. Well, this is what they are expected to obtain in the results of the systematic review, and this hardly appears (it only appears a list of methodologies and little else). They also mix improvement of software processes with improvement of requirements management. Then they indicate that the results are measured by the number of proposals... when previously they have said otherwise. The sections of the review do not faithfully follow those of Kitchenham, and Biolchini. Also in the part of \"search string\" appears \"is that\", which in written language does not look good. The list of sources, why does it appear in the search string grant? In the revision part, Table 3 and Figure 2 are redundant, if one more column is added to the table, indicating the corresponding percentage, we have the same effect. In the Review part, YOU CANNOT DECIDE TO INCLUDE ONLY THE FIRST 20, so why do we do the systematic review???? Also a single grant???. What are the 20 items you selected? Where are they referenced? The same happens with Figure 4 and Table 4. Regarding the Results, it is to be assumed that references 18 to 29 are the primary articles??? In these results they only indicate justifications related to requirements management, but nothing related to what they indicate in the objective of their systematic review. Based on a reference from 2007, number 24, they indicate that it had not dealt with the management of requirements in small companies. I only indicate a doctoral thesis from the UPM of November 2013, entitled Metamodel for the improvement of the requirements management process, whose author is Ariel E. Serrano Rico and Director Jose A. Calvo-Manzano, so that you can see that there are things on requirements management. This is also the only site where they indicate a series of methodologies. This, which is supposed to be one of the expected results, only appears in two lines of the results section. Then it adds a series of key factors, and conditions that seem to appear by themselves, without any reference and that are also not the objective that the authors say regarding the review they have made.",
