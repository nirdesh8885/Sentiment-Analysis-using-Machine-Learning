The originality of the work is not its strong dimension, see long-standing works such as Gorton et al. (1997) and current as Lanunile et al. (2010). However, the relevance of the topic as a reference pattern in activities related to scientific theses, associated with its good presentation, make it a contribution. It is suggested, with a view to publication in a journal, that the efficiency and effectiveness of the activities be compared without the support of these tools versus the current reality (with tools). Examples of possible questions to answer from this exploratory analysis: What are the main activities where the use of collaborative tools is key? What changes in the design of these tools should be developed in the future? Are there student/academic profiles more conducive to the adoption of these platforms?

They also describe specific tools and their benefits, such as Latex and Git. Finally, they propose a workflow for the development of projects of this nature. The main value of the article lies in the application of knowledge that students already master - that is, software development techniques and tools - to a different problem, such as the case of theses and reports. All this, with the aim of making the process more efficient. 1.- The emphasis of the article is the solution without making a detailed analysis of the problem that is intended to be solved. In other words, there are no answers to the following questions: a.- what exactly is the problem? b.- What impacts does this problem generate? c.- Why is it important to solve the problem? d.- What solutions have been implemented to date? e.- What advantages does the proposed solution have with respect to the previous ones? 2.- In my opinion, the article should emphasize more the methodology and workflow. For example, adding a diagram -using a visual language- that allows, on the one hand, to understand the general thesis development process and, on the other, to distinguish the roles, activities and associated technologies in each phase of the report. 3.- Some aspects of the language and the rigor of certain statements must be taken care of, such as: ""(given the rather atrocious spelling enjoyed by engineers)"". Do the authors have any empirical support to support this claim? Is it necessary to resort to such prosaic language to justify the convenience of using a certain technological tool? By the way, I recommend reviewing the expressions: ""it is not public"" (point 3.1) and ""Having access directly..."" (point 3.2)","2010-07-05"

I believe that this manuscript should be directed to the area of cryptography and security, in my specialty, which is computing in distributed environments, I do not see significant relevance and contribution of the manuscript, using RMI in my opinion is not a contribution per se, because RMI is easy to use if JAVA is handled, however, it is not interoperable since it does not support other programming languages, in addition, systems based on RMI as they grow have a performance problem, the more they grow the slower they become, on the other hand , according to some purists a client/server system is not a distributed system, according to others the client/server case is the most basic case of distributed computing, in short, speaking strictly from the area of distributed computing I do not see relevance in this area of this manuscript, however, it seems to me that in another area the paper could be pertinent, since it is an orderly, clear and well-written work. I am not an expert in the area of cryptography, but a few years ago I once heard an Englishman talk about quantum cryptography in a seminar and he mentioned a large number of simulators and applications, he even said that he had applications that already used quantum cryptography among several kilometers through fiber optics, so I think it is best to evaluate this manuscript in that area and not in the area of grid/distributed systems, because in this area the paper, in my opinion, does not have original aspects, since it uses trivial aspects of client/server principles. As I have said before, the paper has more issues of quantum physics and cryptography than distributed computing, for which abstracting myself from the area that concerns me, I see the use of a distributed environment technology used as a client/server, not interoperable and with scalability restrictions. A positive aspect in the paper is that the use of software engineering is appreciated. Regarding the area of grid computing and distributed systems, the manuscript does not contain relevant aspects, it uses RMI to implement a client/server system, however, RMI is easy to use and as a well-known paradigm in computing, performance is opposed to ease of use, RMI does not escape that, because it is easy to use, but it does not have scalability. The document is well presented, perhaps table 2 and table 3 would be better merged using rows as computer and in the columns the details of the ne2rk, especially if there is more than a client/server scheme, for example, a ne2rk distribution ring. quantum keys, with more than 2 computers involved.

The same term must always be used. - There is no evidence of how the gradual 'improvements' of the elicitation process are quantified, and the 'improvement' in the quality of the documentation. How do you measure that improvement? - There are writing and spelling errors, particularly in the use of accents (tildes) and punctuation marks (use of commas and semicolons). The article proposes the use of a work philosophy from another area of engineering, to improve the quality levels of the requirements documents generated in a requirements elicitation process. I consider that from the technical point of view it would be important that they support the analysis of the results that they propose in a quantified measurement or comparison, which allows, through a more formal method than the descriptive one, to generate the conclusions of 'improvement' in the quality of the products. associated with the requirements engineering process. There is no evidence of how they reach the conclusions generated, what are they based on to say that it is better or not, that it has fewer errors or not? It is an interesting proposal that can be applied in real cases of requirements engineering processes. Currently it contributes to reduce the crisis associated with this phase of development of software products. The organization of the document can be improved considerably. I consider that a large part of the article is dedicated to expressing the associated conceptual framework, and less to the application of the technique in the case study and the analysis of results, sections in which the proposal presented can be supported more.

The authors of this article provide no support regarding the validity of this aspect. The article begins stating that the proposal is to improve the elicitation of requirements, however, then it is derived that what is improved is the generation of the SRS. The elicitation and generation of the requirements document are different aspects. In the case of experimentation that is presented, it is not seen anywhere that problems are solved neither in the reduction nor in the generation of the SRS, they are rather implementation problems. The errors detected are basic aspects that any programmer with a minimum of experience knows how to solve, without the need for the SRS to specify the type of minimum validations that must be carried out as part of the system tests.

Per construction machine learning techniques can not classify such outliers."" This sentence should be further explained. As Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman say in The Elements of Statistical Learning (see Chapter 7): ""it is too difficult to give a general rule on how much training data is enough; among other things, this depends on the signal-to-noise ratio of the underlying function, and the complexity of the models being fit to the data. "" So, by just saying that the number of training samples is small you do not provide enough information to decide whether machine learning techniques are adequate or not to solve a problem.

SAVE performs a static check of rules associated with permitted and prohibited dependencies between elements of the design and the code, and allows a report to be delivered on the consistency between both levels with respect to said rules. In general, the tool seems quite powerful for 2 reasons: the use of simple rules and the inclusion of pre-defined rule sets for widely used design patterns. This, in my opinion, is the most important difference with other similar frameworks. The writing is, in some places, not very objective. In particular, I would suggest avoiding excessive use of adjectives for which no supporting evidence is provided. For example, in several places I noticed the use of ""powerful tool"", ""intuitive tool"" or similar (not only referring to SAVE, but to other works). In all these cases, no evidence is explicitly provided to support the use of such adjectives.

The article proposes a requirements planning model, supported by an automatic tool. The prototype they propose is interesting and relevant. I think that the model and method that they propose associated with it, which is actually the real contribution of the authors, can be better organized. I consider that from the technical point of view it would be important that the analysis of the results that they propose with the case study of the bank, be done through an interpretation or quantitative comparison, which really shows that with this automatic planning the quality is really being improved. of the process and/or at least the estimation and actual execution of development times will be shorter, a scenario that, according to background information, has already been justified in its direct relationship with quality. It is an interesting proposal that can be applied in real cases of requirements engineering management processes. Currently, it would contribute to the reduction of time associated with this phase of software product development, and consequently with the quality of the process. Bearing in mind that Requirements Engineering has so many causes and problematic actions, which generate software crises and therefore an affectation in quality management, it remains an open question whether a contribution towards the 'planning' of the requirement really achieves a considerable effect, with respect to other causes or crucial points such as 'prioritization of requirements', validation and/or its traceability as such. The organization of the document can be improved in the following aspects: - Some of the figures that are included are not necessary, since they really do not provide anything additional to what is described in the text, and visually they do not say much. - In the 'APARD Design' section they mention many technical aspects characteristic of reference software factories, which do not give more weight to the intention of the article, nor are they giving really influential data for the application. - The quality of the figures can be optimized (mainly those that show the internal components of the algorithm and the actions of use of the system -profiles, since they are the ones that show the greatest contribution). - There are several drafting errors that should be reviewed (for example: the use of 'on the basis of' should be changed to 'based on'; 'is used', to 'is used'.. )","2010-07-05"

Under this scheme, a low-cost system is developed, with the advantages and limitations of the proposal. - I believe that the proposed system is based on an interesting premise, which is its low cost. Commercial systems for this type of development can be, in most cases, very expensive, depending on the type of elements used. - Despite the simplicity of the proposed architecture, I think the system can be improved. For now, I think there is still a way to go (according to what I read in the paper) in terms of its use beyond the laboratory. That is why ORIGINALITY is rated 4 (good) - One of the first weaknesses found in the publication is its introduction. This sin, in my opinion, of 2 problems: The first problem is that its content is too general, in its entirety it talks about what computer vision is, in general, but interesting aspects such as the state of the art are not detailed on this subject and a relevant bibliography. It is only said in general terms: ""In works related to this topic, it is generally the object that moves in millimeter form..."". From this I have doubts such as: Are there other ways to reconstruct surfaces? Are there similar works? How is this technique different from others? What is the contribution of your work? Why not use stereo vision (perhaps the costs are similar)? The second problem found is a consequence of the first, since when trying to explain what computer vision is, it has been too long (a little more than three columns), and too general. Perhaps if attention had been focused on the state of the art, this would not be seen as a problem. - On the technical side, I see that your approach can work in a very controlled environment, where there are no big changes in lighting and the surface of the scanned objects have colors that are not very similar to the background and/or laser beam used. Background subtraction for controlled environments may work but outdoors I doubt your system will be as stable. I think the text could have listed the different methods used for segmentation. On page 4 it is referred to but not deepened (""Different methods were tried for segmentation, of which the image subtraction method was selected...""). Perhaps it would be good to take advantage of some color space (RBG, YUV, etc.) and use the Mahalanobis distance (get a sample of a laser beam or several) to get a better segmentation of the laser light. - About the presentation, I have found some errors that it would be good to improve: - Figure 2 and figure 3 have the same title, I think there is an error with the title of figure 3. - Figure 2 has some errors and that can lead to mistake ""Light projector"", the ""of"" is underlined. And ""b"" can be confusing since it appears with an underscore. - Some details: - Page 5: ""The above generates them..."" - Page 6: ""which you get better..."" - The laser word appears without accent on some occasions.

Due to this disarticulation, it is possible that the consequence between what is presented in the abstract and what is found in the development of the paper is not very clear. - I consider that the title should not focus only on 'Tools', because when starting to read the work the idea remains that the contribution and review is more at the operational level and of systems that support the process, but not of initiatives in terms of standards, projects and technologies developed for this purpose. The title does not have the scope of the content. The article describes in the Chilean case, what initiatives, trends and technologies could be for the application of software engineering in the field of telemedicine. It does not represent originality as such in either area. The technical quality is good in that the review they describe is supported bibliographically, with current trends, technologies and standards.

Practical experience papers must deliver more than a simple description of the developed system: they must clearly indicate what new knowledge, technique or solution was obtained from said experience. Consequently, a paper of this nature should include, at least, the following essential elements: - An introduction that clearly explains the purpose of the work: (a) the problem that was solved directly or indirectly with the practical experience, (b) why the problem is important and not trivial and (c) why this experience provided new information within that context (not obtained with similar experiences). - Theoretical framework - The description of the system: it should not be a mere enumeration of its components and functionalities, but clearly indicate those elements that, during its development, provided relevant information to the study problem. - Conclusions: they must be aligned with the elements of the introduction and must be supported by the evidence provided in the description of the system. Analyzing the paper from this perspective, we find important problems: First, the introduction is not clear regarding the purpose of the work and. The only part where the objectives are mentioned is in the 5th paragraph, where it is indicated that the case study is ""to empirically demonstrate the development costs"" associated with the technologies shown in the paper. This, along with ""highlighting the main features and potential strengths of CakePHP and MVC.."" seem to be the core elements of the paper. Second, the system description is not very different from a system manual; essential evidence is missing to support the elements of the introduction: associated development costs (time, people, resources) that are supposed to be lower than with another methodology. Although the sections describing CakePHP and MVC have information relevant to the problem, they do not add value to the work if they are not supported by evidence obtained directly from development experience with this technology. Above all, I missed a comparison with some other similar experience, clearly indicating what improvements CakePHP/MVC introduces to development. Finally, the conclusions of the paper are not aligned with the elements indicated in the introduction; some of them deliver information out of context (findings #5 and #6) or are irrelevant (finding #2); others lack supporting evidence (conclusion #1) or are not explicit in associating the evidence with the conclusion (conclusions #3 and #4). Apart from the previous observations, the paper also requires improvements in the presentation of the information. For example, the value that the SQL code in figures 10 and 11 deliver to the paper is not explicit. Figures 12-15 are not adequately described. A person who does not understand command line work well may end up totally disoriented and will not understand the arguments put forward.

In particular, the problem of performing precision welding of electric motors using a robotic arm. The article presents practical aspects of solution development, complemented by illustrations that help understand the problem and the solution development process. Understanding that it is an experience of technology transfer to the industry of specialized support services for the main regional economic activity (mining), the following shortcomings were found: Form aspects: 1. Non-technical terms are recurrently used, which confuse and they do not provide objective background, in addition to writing and spelling errors. for example: child failures --> it should simply be ""failures"" optimal results --> if ""optimal"" is used, evidence must be provided to support that it is the best solution and there is no other better. quite high failure rate --> it is preferable to indicate that the estimated failure rate is 55% (5/9). ""quite high"" is ambiguous. solder --> solder? as required --> as required as General Electric, with very good results --> as General Electric, with good results. 2. always use third person. this was given to us --> this was given what we obtained is the following --> what was obtained was the following 3. It is not relevant to mention certain companies from which certain studies were purchased or commissioned: MOTORFIL, INDURA 4. It is assumed that the reader knows the terms and is able to identify parts such as coils and commutators from the figures. This should not be assumed, and should be explained clearly and simply, and its position illustrated in the figures where electric motors are shown.

There is a text that explains Figure 6, which by the way is a table, that text is not part of the body of the paper, is it? It is very difficult to read that page. I am not an expert in the SIFT algorithm, so when I read the paper it is not clear to me if they used the SiftGPU code created by Changchang Wu or took it as a base and applied some modifications to it. On the other hand, it would have been interesting to know why the implementation in CUDA, the implementation in multicore and the serial could give different results, if after all the three approaches are the SIFT algorithm. I have been programming parallel applications for more than 12 years and for the same algorithm I have never observed different results, if after all the algorithm is the same, now, when variants are introduced to the original algorithm in order to force parallelism, have different results, but it is no longer the original algorithm. Reading other papers on the subject, I do not find so much originality, the document does not help much to draw conclusions either. The paper has data from runs and compares different approaches, but I still have a big question as to why the same algorithm with a sequential approach and a parallel one with GPU can yield different results. GPU is an issue that has its thanks, especially for the money savings that its use implies in the long term, so it could be good to spread this work to spread this technology.

General comments:  a) Concerning the proposed approach: The segmentation method introduced only considers local color/gray value information. Perhaps introducing other features related to the membrane's local (e.g. the membrane has symmetry properties that can be exploited) or global (e.g. continuity, approximately circular shape) properties may improve the segmentation results.  Feature selection is also a key component to improve performance. Use a feature selection procedure.  b) Concerning the experimentation: You should describe the experiments with sufficient detail so others can replicate them: a) Make your data publicly available b) Explain how you have selected the classifier's parameters (parameter selection in an SVM is critical and may improve notably the performance).  You should join Figs 10 and 9 in a single plot so we can better see the differences.  You only provide qualitative segmentation results (Figs. 12, 14, 15), but quantitative results are also very important. Specially when it comes to comparisons. You should quantitatively compare your algorithm with other competing works in the literature.  c) Concerning paper organization: The paper is well written and clearly introduces the problem, describes the relevant literature and presents the solution.

"","","","","3","0","2","is","-1","","The article deals with the construction of content-based image retrieval systems (of images), CBIR. The CBIR problem is introduced and some algorithms are presented that allow to speed up the search for nearest neighbors to an input vector (corresponding to an image) in the feature space chosen to represent the images. Color-, frequency-response-, and global-based features are used for each of the local frames into which an input image is divided. In this way, information of different types is introduced to the CBIR system to represent the images. - The article does not clearly define its contributions. It seems to add something in terms of the feature space in which the images are represented and it also seems to add something to the algorithms and data structures needed to speed up searches in metric spaces. - In general, the article uses little space to explain the proposed approach to CBIR (2 references to master's theses are given). Experimental results are presented in the conclusions, when clearly they should go in a previous section with the experiments. - Regarding the visual characteristics used to represent an image: Experiments are lacking that allow establishing what each of the characteristics proposed to use contributes. That is, I think it is important to answer the question: Why are you here and not others? and also to the question: Is any of them redundant and could it be stopped being used? Although it is true that a feature selection procedure is used, an experiment establishing the effect of the selection is missing. How much is gained in success rate over the use of the complete vector? It appears that the feature space after selection has dimension 3078 (section 2.4). Is it so or have the 3078 features been ""manually"" extracted? - The CBIR systems comparison experiment (section 2.3) is not understood. What is done with the 100 images common to databases? Is the same query made in all systems and is precision and recall measured using only the 100 common images when they appear or not in the system's response? That is not explained at all in the article. - When data such as sensitivity and specificity are given in the conclusions, it must be said on which data set it has been tested. It is possible to do a test on some data and obtain a completely different result on others. Therefore sensitivity and specificity without reference to the data from which it has been obtained are meaningless. - It seems to this reviewer that an article on CBIR should not overlook developments in Computer Vision based on (already classic) local features such as: Sivic, J. and Zisserman, A. Video Google: A Text Retrieval Approach to Object Matching in Videos Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (2003) D. Nistér and H. Stewénius, Scalable recognition with a vocabulary tree Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (2006) - Some of the references, such as the [10,11,13], are incomplete. What do they mean? An article? An example system running on a URL? - The system working in the URL that the authors refer to gives execution errors when trying to test with images extracted from google images.","2010-07-05"

[1] ""Parallel metric structures in image retrieval"", Peña-Jaramillo, E. (Referenced in the paper) [2] ""Definition of an Image Retriever based on Contents on Metric Spaces"", Eduardo Peña-Jaramillo, et to the. (Not referenced). [3] ""Parallel Metric Structures in Image Retrieval on the Web"", Eduardo Peña-Jaramillo, et al. (Not referenced). About reference number [1] it has not been possible to obtain an electronic copy, and from the aforementioned publications [2] and [3], it can be said that there is a new contribution in the experiments carried out on GNAT and Spaghetis structures. It must be explained in the publication that the work is not original from the author's point of view, and that its extension is based on the works [1], [2], [3] or another that is directly related to the work presented. . - The text is well structured and it is easy to understand what you want to expose. - Good presentation, no serious problems. Only improve the figures of the graphs, especially the accents, in matlab you can add text in latex to avoid this type of problem. The word ""more"" appears a couple of times without a tilde. - In the ""Introduction"" section, although the work is presented in a general way, I think it would be important to point out the state of the art in these matters. Are there related works? Are there important references? What is the contribution of the work to the state of the art?, etc. A more exhaustive bibliographic review is lacking. - In the ""Feature Extraction"" section I have found some details such as: - It has been difficult for me to find a definition on the layout technique since there is only one reference [1], so I suspect that the characteristics obtained from each sub-image as a signal which are mixed to obtain the vector that represents the total image, as it says in the text: ""The union of all the extracted characteristics gives us as a result..."", where it is not clear the type ""join"" that is performed. - The same thing also happens when the Fisher discriminant is referenced, again reference is made to [1]. A more relevant source should be added for this point. - The type of database used is not explained in detail. Is it public or private domain? What kind of images or groups of images it contains. How many are there per class? Are there repeated images? Quality of the images. The idea is to have a frame of reference so that anyone who wants to compare their algorithms with theirs can do so on equal terms. - From the images shown in figure 2, I can deduce that the database (I hope I am wrong) has repeated images, which can produce a bias when calculating the values of precision, sensitivity and specificity of the retrieved images. I believe that the ideal database to be able to correctly measure the quality of the recovery should have different images even if they have the same appearance, but never the same. Since when retrieving a set of images over a query image, if they are repeated, the number of true positives will be proportional to the repeated ones, which will result in a bias on the calculation of the metrics. Recommendations - In the text it is mentioned (conclusions section) that the solutions are not entirely satisfactory. I think there are currently projects like http://similar-images.googlelabs.com/, http://www.like.com/, http://www.tineye.com/, among others; that show great progress in this field and would be good to be reviewed. - On the other hand, regarding the set of features used, I recommend reviewing other types of features that have been shown to be invariant to scale and rotation.

I consider the proposal interesting and relevant, however the work has weaknesses in its construction. The promise of the title is diluted in the abstract and the introduction, with the “intro” of SPEM as a tool. Then, in the body of the article, the link between SPEM and the proposed quality measurement method is not clear. The case study on which they are basing their work is also unclear. Modeling in SPEM is about SCRUM in a theoretical way in about the case study. The evaluation of the method does not seem to measure the quality of the software, but the criteria of those involved with respect to adherence to the modeled process. And in any case, it always measures intermediate documents of the process and not defects or primary attributes of the quality of the software produced. Minor comments: - Review the construction of the references - The SCRUM modeling does not include the retrospective meeting. If you are modeling a particular SCRUM implementation, make it clear in the body of the paper. Otherwise it is a major modeling error. - Why do you use a traditional process to model an agile process?

To exemplify the steps to follow, the author used a mobile robot called AMADEUS (similar to cleaning robots marketed in Japan [1]). To apply the concepts of fuzzy logic, the Mamdani module was used. General evaluation. The topic is extremely interesting and very recurrent lately. Devices that use fuzzy logic to operate is a very interesting and novel bridge between Artificial Intelligence and ""pervasive computing"". However, this work has at least one important weakness that should be resolved: 1) In the work it doesn't show why it is really important to use fuzzy logic. An example application is strongly recommended for the job. How would using fuzzy logic help on mobile devices? 2) At work it is not very clear to me if the use of fuzzy logic in mobile devices is something new in this area. If it is not something new, perhaps the work could become just a repetition of another work. If it's something new, please mention it.

The document shows a proposal for a template with a series of questions to analyze the quality of different quality attributes of a developed software product. However, the document lacks structure. The writing is poor. In some parts of the document, the format parameters required in the authors' guide are not followed. For example, the abstract is centered and according to the event guide it must be justified. Some paragraphs of the document are presented in the same way. In terms of wording, the document is difficult to read, punctuation marks are missing or misplaced. The keywords do not match as article keywords. There is a lack of bibliographical references that support the affirmations that are made. Although the template can be as useful as they try to claim at work, it is necessary to look for a more consolidated validation that allows to ensure its usefulness. The statistics presented lack valid justifications and the presentation format is poor. Much of the document focuses on making claims described in the ISO 1926 standard and: 1. It is not properly cited as the main reference of the work. 2. Focusing the article to summarize the definition of each characteristic or sub-characteristic of the standard does not seem very appropriate for this type of work. The presentation format of the template lacks clarity. It seems that it is a questionnaire format but it is not shown as such. There is a list of unclear statements and questions. Some of these questions are mentioned in the results, however they do not appear in the list named by the author as ""template"", it is the case of: Does the system operate together with another system?

Although it is true that it fits the scope of the event and its proposal may be of interest to software engineers who wish to have some practical instrument to apply in their quality systems, the work has serious deficiencies that must be improved to be published. The technical presentation of the document has shortcomings that do not meet the standards established for writing the article. In particular, we can mention a few: - The format is not uniform, as can be seen in the abstract, which has different settings in its extension. There are also differences in spacing after each paragraph. Sometimes it exists and sometimes it doesn't. The bullets have different indentations. Bibliographical references have different indentations. - The most serious is spelling and writing. The document requires a major editing review. In just the first 2 paragraphs of the introduction I have found more than 5 faults. Regarding its structure, I think it should be reorganized to improve its presentation. I think the objectives should go inside the introduction. The presentation of the ISO criteria should be summarized in a descriptive table. It's annoyingly long and I think it can be referenced for details. On the other hand, I think it should be clarified if the template is pre-existing or is a proposal of the work, in which case it should be highlighted since it would be the main contribution of the article. Your presentation is unfortunate. I think it should be summarized in a table and clearly state what can be answered. Most are not even presented as questions. I insist that if the template is the contribution it should be made easier for other engineers to use. Your presentation does not help this. (eg the first, ""When interacting with the system, notice how predictable it is"": what do I say?) The instrument should be self-contained so that it clearly contains guidance for its application. Furthermore, it doesn't provide clarity on how I combine query responses to get a quality metric. I think there is too much work left for the reader. The results are not presented in a readable way. I think a table would help. It even mentions several times the tabulation of the results but this does not appear. As it is a case study, I would like to see in that table the answers that were obtained and how the percentages that measure quality were calculated.","2013-07-05"

The article seeks to show the applications of Biological Immune Systems in computing. To do this, the article begins by describing the theory on the Biological Immune System of vertebrates, which defines, in addition to explaining its operation. He then describes biological models as a theoretical review of the subject. Finally, it describes the characteristics of artificial immune systems and details the different fields of application. General evaluation. The subject of the article is extremely interesting, and rarely seen (at least by me). As the article postulates, it makes a bibliographic review of the theory and provides a description of the variety of applications that this field of study has. It manages to summarize these concepts that can effectively serve as a frame of reference within the literary. However, the article has some weaknesses: 1) The great weakness of the article is its structure. The article does not follow the standard format of a scientific article. Here I present some examples. a) The introduction does not present the structure that the article follows, nor a general idea of what the authors want to achieve. b) There is no outline of the ideas of each section, nor an introduction per section. This means that there is no clear proposal by the authors and what they try to propose is only seen on the last page. 2) Another weakness is that it does not establish any way to evaluate and compare the different applications of the subject in order to connect them with the theory and present a contribution of the article. For this reason, it does not comply with what is established in its abstract: ""... to establish guidelines for the application of these techniques in the different areas of knowledge."" 3) Another problem is that it does not establish any type of conclusion or the implications of the article, which ends with the description of an application in combinatorial optimization. Other comments. Minor drafting problems: a) ""...and the molecules belonging to external (not self) antigens, which ultimately constitute a threat to the organism...""

Thus, studying word of mouth marketing, one of the oldest and most reliable records applied to social ne2rks, is of great importance.

The article is presented clearly in its writing and the summary of designed architecture is appreciated, and it could be an interesting article to be presented at our congress. My main objections are: - Figure 7 presents graphs with a 10-minute window, while the proposal indicates 5 minutes - In my opinion, the system does not represent a data mining process because there is no new actionable knowledge, but rather it is a classification system. There may be new knowledge, but the document does not reflect how the realized system helped to obtain new knowledge of the attacks. - There is little explanation and lack of experimentation to argue and justify the use of DBSCAN over another type of clustering or even instead of a classifier. - It is known that a SYN-FLOOD attack produces a high number of connections at a given time, so it is not clear if such a sophisticated system is necessary to detect this phenomenon, this could be clarified if the comparison with other approaches were included .","2013-07-05"

Basically, the model considers three properties to evaluate its quality: social ability, autonomy and proactivity. To evaluate these properties, the author breaks these properties down into several measurable sub-properties. The author evaluates this model through a case study: a banking system. General Comments: Notarially, the structure of the document has the necessary aspects to be considered a scientific article. The contribution of the article seems to be relevant. That said, this work lacks some points that (for me) are important to address: * The author mentions that there is no model to evaluate the quality of agent software, and he proposes one. His proposal is an adaptation of ISO/IEC, however, the author does not justify why it is appropriate. * Regarding the previous point, paragraph 1 of the introduction says that there is no model that measures the quality of software. Then paragraph 2 mentions that there are some works about this. The author should clarify his contribution. * The author mentions that software was developed for this work, however, this work is listed as yet another publication (and by another author). If the mentioned software is not part of the contributions of the work, please delete these sentences. Other comments: * In the case study section it is not so easy to understand. For example, figures 2, 5 and 7 do not understand what their acronyms refer to (eg AMS). I guess they correspond to the sub-properties. * It is recommended to exchange section 3 for section 2. That is, first explain what an agent is and then talk about the related work. * It is not clear to me if it is ""software agent"" or ""software agent"". Furthermore, the author also confuses this terminology (first sentence of section 4).","2013-07-05"

For this, a language (LATIN) and a ¿universal? MED data model are proposed, based on a ""spherical volume"" with 2 poles ""major"" and ""daily"" based on accounting ideas. This is, in my opinion, the most critical aspect of the proposal, since it raises the question of whether every system should fit into this scheme, or are we talking about a particular set of cases. The subsequent ideas are interesting and, at least, they generate a break with respect to the classic ideas of object orientation. I quote the proposed system idea: ""a system is a set of linked and inter-acting classes according to the same method, which is not particular to each class but emerges from all of them"". Other ideas associate transaction with referential set, macros, types, instances, ... which in global terms constitute a new body of ideas. Not having in the references any citation to a previous article by the author that deals with these ideas, it seems to me that it may be interesting to listen to this proposal and discuss it.

Developing interpreters using the ANTLR tool on Android is the main connection of these activities. The first activity implements a parser/interpreter for a calculator. The second activity incorporates the ability to sort lists in the interpreter. The last activity incorporates the voice recognition service using a Google library. According to the work, the result of these activities allowed students to better understand the concepts of formal languages. General Evaluation: The work describes very clearly how the activities were carried out in the elective course. However, from my point of view, the work has 2 major weaknesses: 1) The main motivation of the work is that the use of ANTLR tools is useful for formal language courses. However, a sample of why this statement is true is never offered, only how to implement the activity software is detailed. It is strongly recommended to give real signs (eg justifications, experiments, etc.) of why these tools help the teaching of these topics. 2) This point is the cause of the previous point. There is no motivation or problem that clearly shows the need to use these tools for a language course. If the authors manage to find a clear and measurable motivation, point 1) can be solved. Finally, the work fails to convince with its conclusion. Minor comments: 1) The work exceeds the maximum required number of pages (9 (>8) pages). 2) In the conclusion it is stated that with the use of ANTLR in Android and the knowledge of formal languages it is possible to match the tools of Siri (Apple) & Google Now. In my opinion, that statement is not true, because to solve the activities they use Google APIs, meaning that without Google products, these activities cannot be carried out. In short, ANTLR and knowledge of formal languages are not enough to build Google Now. 3) It would be nice to use the canonical DSL references instead of the ones used in the work: @article{vanDeursen:2000:DLA:352029.352035, author = {van Deursen, Arie and Klint, Paul and Visser, Joost}, title = { Domain-specific languages: an annotated bibliography}, journal = {SIGPLAN Not.}, issue_date = {June 2000}, volume = {35}, number = {6}, month = jun, year = {2000}, issn = { 0362-1340}, pages = {26--36}, numpages = {11}, url = {http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/352029.352035}, doi = {10.1145/352029.352035}, acmid = {352035 }, publisher = {ACM}, address = {New York, NY, USA}, } @article{Mernik:2005:DDL:1118890.1118892, author = {Mernik, Marjan and Heering, Jan and Sloane, Anthony M.}, title = {When and how to develop domain-specific languages}, journal = {ACM Comput.

From the case, I think it was possible to make a greater contribution, perhaps proposing a methodology to address the review of business processes, considering that the internal and external actors of the company generally prioritize the optimization of their production processes more than the review of other processes. Last but not least, the emphasis of the article is the review (audit) of the process with BPMN, moving away from the themes of the congress. More emphasis could be given to applications associated with the congress, such as requirements analysis from BPMN, SOA implementation from BPMN, process monitoring with BAM and BPMN, etc. In some figures, although contractors are mentioned as an external entity, a ""lane"" is not used to represent them and thus observe the interaction with the process under review. The proposed future work is related to the results obtained from the improvements implemented from the analysis carried out in this work.

The generalization of the results and the discussion of threats to validity should be part of the discussion. For example: What kind of obstacles does each algorithm work on?

IT management capacity is a key element for professionals in the area and not only their technological skills. It seems relevant to study how these competencies impact professional success, or, at least, on the subjective perception of said success. The study contains references to relevant sources, although it is suggested to reduce the number and prioritize in the case of articles in journals or conferences. Although the topic is relevant, there are some risks in the definition of the constructs that are not analyzed. What are the limits between the perception of professional and personal success? Is it possible to carry out a study of the perception of professional success only considering the BTM model and leaving out technological skills? Does the study apply to all IT professionals or only to those who manage technology projects as CIOs? The main weakness of the research is that it is identified as an experimental method, when in reality the survey does not have the degree of control over the object of study to be classified in this way. There is also talk of a causality study, but the survey would only allow a co-relationship study. About the survey it is explained which are the evaluated factors and the Likert scale. However, there are no examples of specific questions and an explanation of how they will be answered by the subjects. For example: Is it feasible for a person to assess your commitment or leadership? Although the relationship is being evaluated in general terms and not in terms of its own, it would be advisable to carry out a validation of the model first and then the survey itself with a group of experts or managers of IT professionals.","2014-07-05"

For the technical/scientific community of software engineering it is evident that the approaches have different starting points, but they are combinable. This is especially true for software process improvement experts. The review that is done on the research of the combination of agility and CMMI is not systematic. By state of the art we do not mean a simple description of each approach, but rather collect the most up-to-date research on this topic. Although it may be interesting to map between process areas and agile practices, it is not explained what steps are going to be followed to do this.

An emphasis made by the authors is that this integration is recommended for SMEs. Software development for the smallest companies is an unsolved challenge. As such, the authors take a topic that is interesting and well justify the idea of the topic. However, I think they fail to develop their point in the way that would be expected from a scientific point of view. Although the authors indicate that they do a review of the literature, this is not adequately achieved, since a systematic review methodology of this goal is not observed. On the other hand, the article in my opinion makes a suitable summary for people who do not belong to the area but are familiar with some key concepts described in the paper. It is worth mentioning that it seems to me to be a well-written and planned article, in general, with an easy-to-understand structure. In addition, another criticism I would make is that although the ideas of CMMI and agile development seem well described to me, the same does not happen with respect to adequately justifying their specific application in SMEs. I think the article could be substantially improved. One suggestion I would make for this would be the presentation of a case that strengthens the central argument of the article, that is, CMMI and agile development are compatible and especially useful for SMEs. In this way, less emphasis could be given to the revision (which seems insufficient in that sense) and the practical relevance of the argument would be raised. If so, the article could have an interesting projection. In addition, the inclusion of references should be improved since there are a large number of arguments that deserve to be clarified if they belong to an opinion of the authors or are extracted from existing theory.

Three questions are raised that are answered later in the analysis of the results through tables and graphs; concluding several similarities between communities and that there is collaboration between IS researchers, which is unfortunately mostly intra-institutional.

The authors qualitatively evaluate the performance of the interface in terms of the ease of interpretation of the information it provides. To do this, they expose the information to a group of users. The evaluation method by users is a known and validated one. However, the article very briefly explains the user validation process used. On the other hand, the results of the evaluation presented are only descriptive. Statistical techniques for measuring interpreter consensus such as the Kappa index or others could have been used to analyze the quality of the agreement between the evaluators.

In the words of the authors ""The objective of this work is to carry out a review of the state of the art regarding the treatment of point clouds"". In my opinion it does not achieve this objective declared by them. My reasons are stated below. First, it is noteworthy that as an article that pretends to establish the state of the art, it has a very scarce bibliography (14 articles). In that sense, it would be more appropriate to indicate that this work is of a preliminary nature (if that is the case) since in this way such a low number of reviewed articles would be justified. Second, and what seems to me to be of greater relevance, the work does not make an adequate summary of the bibliography, but rather it seems to be a note on some filtering and segmentation methods. A review of the state of the art, in my opinion, should have a purpose such as identifying the main gaps in the literature or research opportunities. Third, although a literature review is essentially an abstract, it must be systematic. That is, it must have a method that has to be specified. For example, what was the search equation used and what was the time range and selection criteria of the reviewed articles or which were eliminated and why. Finally, although it has nothing to do with the content or the objective of the article, there are obvious formatting problems. For example, the entire conclusion section is centered rather than justified. In addition, there are drafting problems that in some parts make it difficult to understand the text. For example, the first paragraph in the ""Segmentation"" subsection says ""The process of generating a surface model from a cloud of points, the segmentation that extracts the edges and partitions of the 3D world, the points play an important role in the fitting of The surfaces."" There are also misspellings such as writing ""laser"" and ""laser"" in different parts of the document. In summary, the article does not achieve its objective of being a review of the state of the art and, in addition, it has obvious formatting errors.","2014-07-05"

The co-creation of value with the client is proposed as a method of creating value. In order to analyze the contribution of co-creation, the concept of traceability is introduced. It then explains a series of variables proposed to measure the co-created value under a conceptual model together with another model that allows the traceability of the different contributions through links. Finally, the results of the model in one case are briefly exposed. Evaluation: Implementing types of co-creation is very important for organizations today. It is interesting how the article mixes co-creation with traceability and proposes ways to measure it, presenting new tools for the organization. Unfortunately, the article has great weaknesses: 1) The scope may not be appropriate for a congress like INFONOR. 2) The results are brief and weakly exemplified, which makes it difficult to understand the use of the model. 3) More examples could be used for readability purposes. 4) The format of the paper has problems.

The work is focused on a business case, however, although the document emphasizes the theoretical compilation of the concepts associated with the financial and cost aspects of contracted IT services, the case study is not clear and the article seems incomplete. The structure of the document generates confusion because in the introduction objectives associated with the case study are established, but at the end of the document the results are not presented because the research is in progress. It is suggested to limit the article and structure it better, in such a way that the preliminary results obtained up to the point where the research project is found can be presented, that is, a conceptual review of financial aspects for IT Services, without generating expectations regarding to the development of statistics or analysis of costs that have not yet been calculated. In order to have a strong emphasis on reviewing concepts, the article is sparsely referenced. It is recommended to improve the concepts and the conceptual basis from a comprehensive literature review that allows to base the research and present partial results of the review of concepts. There are marked deficiencies in the drafting of the document. Letters are missing from the abstract and punctuation marks are not clear. In paragraphs like the first of the second column on page 3, it is difficult to understand the idea and that makes it difficult to read the document. In sections defining concepts such as IT Costs (page 3) it is necessary to refer to the conceptual statements (fundamental basis of the article). It is recommended to take into account the terms in English to unify the way of citing terms or concepts. Some cannot be translated, but it is advisable to handle concepts in only one language. In addition, it is advisable to define the objective of the article and focus it on a single purpose. That is, if you want to present the methodology for the design of the research, emphasis should be placed on it. Or, if what you want is to emphasize the calculations established or designed by means of the tool, then focus the article on this objective. As a general recommendation, it is suggested to focus the article on a conceptual review of the financial costs of contracting IT services in Chilean companies, taking into account that the research is at an early stage.","2014-07-05"

This application is characterized by a screen divided into a 16x16 matrix, where each cell is a news item. OVERALL EVALUATION: The work is well written and follows a format (almost) completely suitable for INFONOR. The app sounds interesting and potentially useful as an add-on for already commonly used social ne2rks (eg Facebook). There are several independent points that I consider to be important to resolve: 1) Although it is an interesting engineering work, I cannot see what the contribution/contribution is from the scientific point of view. What can be re-used from this work for a future work? scientific? 2) Since you offer an application, I think a link to (com)test this application is essential. 3) In my opinion, the website http://terra.cl is close to what is proposed by this work. This is so, because terra allows users to register (profiles), comment on news, rate news, and configure the website to display the news that a user wants. 4) This could be a minor detail, I think that the use of social ne2rks could be used for something more than just showing the most important news (eg showing a kind of tracking (social) of a similar news(ies) ). MINOR DETAILS: - At the end of the introduction, the use of BOLD is not recommended. - “The headlines do not carry out a good analysis”. What is a ""good"" analysis? During the work, several adjectives used in an ambiguous way and that are unnecessary are observed (eg “complex process” in section 2.1). - Within section 2: “Development”, there is the related work (section 2.1). This section should be restructured. - Citations of the type “X, et al., YEAR” (eg section 2.2 “Wilson, et al., 2014”), I think are incorrect. They should use ""et al"". - Section 2.2, is the coincidence of words enough to say that 2 news items are similar?

The theme of the work is fundamentally oriented to present and comment on the InfoCom application and how it eventually works in the company. However, in terms of its theoretical and methodological discussion and the analysis of the results, this article presents multiple shortcomings that are detailed below: The introduction of the article in general highlights the relevance of the application built for the company in particular but does not detail the innovative of this proposal and why this information system is better in terms of development or what are the characteristics that distinguish it from what currently exists in the market. Nor does the author clearly establish the motivation that has led him to develop a new solution for the problem posed. A research objective as such of the article is not defined since it is mentioned that this will be to ""expose a commercial information system adaptable to any retail business......"" . In general, it is desired to present the built application and it is not specified what is expected from the article, the methodologies to be used and what is innovative in terms of development for the discipline of information systems. One of the main limitations of this article is the state of the art. The review of the literature is almost non-existent in relation to the theories that support the development of the application and the main authors on platform development issues of this nature are not mentioned. No theoretical framework is established in the article in terms of design or implementation of the application. Proposals are not discussed in those terms either, so it is possible to say that there are no theoretical references in terms of analysis, design and implementation. This difficulty means that the evaluation of what has been developed is only based on general opinions about what the concept of information systems is. The research methodology is another important shortcoming of this article. The article moves between the importance of the application to a description of what is possible to do with it without establishing clear and accepted development and implementation methodologies (either for the design of the tool or for the analysis of the results obtained from its use). ). This complicates the evaluation of the work since there are no research questions to answer, nor ways to evaluate if the author's expectations are met or if the results obtained will be valid. The author of the article should present and describe the research designs to be used to allow their validity to be evaluated. Most of the article is in the development item and it defines and details the characteristics of the company in which the study will be developed. It is not clearly specified which parts of the system are acquired commercially and which are developed internally and how the connection with other existing platforms is achieved. Nor are process or data models associated with this construction established. The authors limit themselves to explaining the functionalities of the tool and how it will be used in the company, but it is not possible to know how it was implemented and compare the results that stand out as relevant from the implementation. Although the tool may be very simple from a design and architecture point of view, a description that presents process models using ad-hoc tools and at least a description of the design stage would be expected. The results obtained are generally mentioned as something that was achieved and as percentages of improvements in management and it is not possible to draw valid conclusions about them. The conclusion of the article is weak in terms of the results obtained from the design and implementation of the application and, above all, the contribution of the study to the discipline of information systems. I consider that the article requires major changes and that work must be done on the definition of the objective, the methodology to be used for the analysis and design of the platform.

The proposed model is aimed at decoupling business logic from business rules. The problem addressed in the article is adequately supported by the difficulties mentioned in the field of software projects and in the financial world. The author could go a little deeper into the experiences of project development in other areas and the relevance of business rules in the development of efficient information systems in the company. The objective declared by the author is to propose a methodology that allows flexibility in the operation of information systems in financial entities, which is generally explained adequately. The literature review is relevant to the issues addressed and the theories and models considered are appropriate to the objective that has been set. The analyzes associated with the concept of business rules and system architecture are related to the topic. The author should specify how the relationship between process modeling and the design and characterization of business rules is established. It is mentioned that they use the decision point tables, but these are not mentioned in detail or visually. The author should better support the choice of “Pipes and Filter” as the architecture model of the system. It would also be important to highlight if there are similar works carried out in other areas (since the author does not mention it) The methodological aspect of the work focuses on describing the process through which the definition of the software architecture is reached to automate the rules of business and the tools that were used in its development. This methodological approach is appropriate and is clearly associated with a case study application. The important contribution in this aspect is the detailed description of the process from the lifting of the rules to the design and development of the proposed application architecture. The author should make a summary table in which this process is represented in summary form. It is clear that the results of this work have the desired validity, since it is based on the use of models and tools already validated in the field of rule-based business platform design. The contribution of the work is important since it systematizes a process that is widely used in the development of information systems that are flexible and adaptable to the changing environment.

In the summary it is indicated that the objective of the work is to propose a business rules automation model that manages to decouple the business logic, however during the document no reference is made to any model. A methodology is presented in the section with its name, but it is not clear how this methodology allows generating a business rules automation model. The article lacks a logical sequence of sections that account for the explicit proposal cited in the abstract. In the System Architecture section, the architecture of a system is presented and aspects of the architecture are explained. However, in this section it is not possible to identify a model for automating business rules. Taking into account that the article lacks a strong job to improve its presentation that allows understanding the proposal that is made, I suggest rejecting it. Below I send some observations that can be used to improve the work: Although the methodology used is explained in detail by phases, in none of them is reference made to the results achieved in its implementation in the case of the work that is exposed, that is, applied in an environment of financial entities. In the system architecture section, figure 5 and figure 6 are presented but they are not explained or contextualized within the document. This creates confusion. This section does not identify the application of the methodology set out in the previous section, in relation to the generated architecture. It should be clearly indicated how the architecture was achieved based on the methodology selected and explained in the Methodology section. In the introduction it is clear what is the proposal of the work presented. A paragraph must be structured that includes a definition of the objective of the work and the proposed solution that is made taking into account the title of the work. Some drafting errors must be corrected, such as: - In the abstract... For what purpose is it proposed...? - In the introduction... one of the main challenges of software engineering is not to generate...? - On page 3, the phase A term has a meaning for the business that must be understood and shared, is repeated twice. - On page 4 the word valido has an accent and in the last paragraph the accent is outside the word esta´. - At the end of page 5 the title is divided (widow). - It is suggested to improve the wording of the paragraph... The architectural vulnerability of the software systems has been observed in the provision of the services it provides with respect to the drafts... -The figures are not cited in the text, they are only indicated following figure, which constitutes problems both in form and edition of the article.

The wording should be corrected. - In the Methodology section, reference is made to a project that has not been described before.

"","136","reject","","3","-1","1","is","0","","Throughout the article, the role of test automation within software testing and more generally in the assurance framework is exaggerated. A maturity model for software testing necessarily includes more than just automation. Automated cases will always co-exist with manual cases and human assessments. As discussed in the article, automation is too general a concept, it can encompass generation, execution, evaluation (for example: mutation, coverage criteria) and validation (oracle problem). Although the motivation is clearly stated in the introduction, references are needed to substantiate the claims made about the role of testing and the impact of automation on testing. To say that automation makes testing faster or cheaper is simplistic: it depends on the context. The costs of generating automatic test cases, the estimation on the future evaluation of the software and the expiration of the test cases, along with other factors, must be taken into account in the cost model to determine the convenience of automating a certain part of the test. the proof. The section dedicated to software testing makes general definitions and walks through the history of testing since the mainframes. For a research article, I suggest making more specific definitions related to the focus of the study (experimental studies on test techniques, automation, test costs, maturity models). It would be appropriate to put the development of the maturity model after presenting the related work. The process to obtain the proposal of a maturity model for testing is not described. The development of the model must be linked to other existing maturity models (for example the Testing Maturity Model), establish connections with the accepted testing literature or standards (for example ISO 29119) and in general with software process models. The search string used is not specified. Not all models found should be classified as 'maturity models'. Some of the included models are clearly more general models, not addressing the problem of test automation. These differences should at least be discussed. The attributes used in table III are not explained, nor how to obtain the maturity level results. What does 'level of published reviews' mean? This concept is ambiguous. The description of this research process should be reinforced as it is key to obtaining the 'adolescent' level result.","2015-07-05"

The research proposal is not clear and the scope they propose covers several fronts, possibly the reason why there is disorder in the topics they address.","The paper is titled ""Current Maturity of Software Test Automation Development."" The document shows a series of sections that account for a work carried out in terms of literature review and some approaches to a proposal to restructure a particular scale of maturity levels for the test automation process. However, the work lacks a logical structure that allows determining if its contribution or main objective is in the literature review or in the proposal of new levels of maturity for the testing process. It is recommended to make a complete review of the information presented and possibly restructure the document presented. The report of this review was divided into sections, in order to provide suggestions to improve the work. Section -Systematic Review It is important that the authors review the fact of using a systematic review method that has not yet been published, since there are several published, tested and recognized methods for Software engineering. They should justify the selection of the method proposed by Serna M. identified with the number [16] in the work. It is essential to explain the validation that is done regarding the peer review of the articles, since it is not clear how a peer review of the published articles can be accessed in order to validate them and how a validation process is carried out from of said information, taking into account the number of revisions that would have to be made for each article found (978). Test automation Although, in the work a proposed model is reported to evaluate the maturity of the software test automation process. The model as such is not described. The article is limited to presenting a reference scale associated with the maturity of a human being. Therefore, it is essential that the article indicates several aspects to consider the structuring and definition of a model. Among the most important aspects to consider are: 1. A scientific and formal justification on which the authors of the work are based to propose the maturity model and the selection of the maturity levels of a human being as a point of comparison with a possible maturity level of the test automation process. 2. Formal justification of why not to use the CMMI model and the structure of maturity levels proposed in it to evaluate the test automation process. The foregoing, taking into account that the maturity model defines an appropriate maturity scale to evaluate processes in software engineering. In other words, why is it necessary to rethink those maturity levels for the test automation process and propose a new scale based on the maturity of a human being? 3. At the research level, how are maturity levels characterized in terms of test automation? Although the article characterizes each level indicating the possible characteristics in which the test automation process is, it does not indicate how said characterization was determined, nor is a related formal and scientific justification shown. Related work The work presents a systematic review, under which it is possible to identify work related to the area of study, in this case test automation or maturity levels for test automation. However, the authors present the systematic review separately from the related work section, when it appears that the studies selected as related work should be part of the analysis of the results of the systematic review. In addition, the systematic review allows the identification of research gaps or niches (research opportunities) to determine a work area with a specific problem and, from there, propose a possible solution to said problem. In this case, the article presents the systematic review as an additional work and subsequent to the proposal of maturity levels for the test automation process. Likewise, the authors show the selection of some related works, it is understood that they are related to test automation, notwithstanding the first Michael Grottke, they indicate precisely that it does not focus on the subject to be treated in the work they present but on a Statistical proposal of test automation. Therefore it would not enter as related work. Software Test Automation Development Maturity To compare the test automation process and its maturity levels, the authors present Table 3. It indicates that the first column lists the traditional stages of a test automation process. testing process. It is necessary to indicate under what methodology these stages are selected as traditional or to have a reference as justification for the selection of these and not other stages. In this section there is no clear explanation of the determination of maturity levels at each stage. It is essential to have a description of the research analysis carried out, which results in the definition of the maturity level of each of the stages of the testing process. The table is not a sufficient explanation for the analysis, since it only reports the results. At this point, if what is sought is to propose a new maturity scale for the test process or test automation, the most convenient thing is to validate said proposed scale with a case study. In this work, although the authors show a table where they seem to determine that the maturity level is ""adolescent"", it is not possible to understand in what context the test automation process is being evaluated. At least one case should be contextualized where it is indicated: region, time, type of projects or companies and methodology used to evaluate the test automation process. The foregoing is the basis for justifying that in a given context the test automation process is at X level of maturity (of the proposed scale). Arguing, in addition, the criteria that were taken into account to assign said level of maturity.","2015-07-05"

Some models are treated first in a preliminary section and others after the theoretical analysis, I suggest re-organizing the presentation of concepts. In my opinion, the concepts of quality model and conceptual model are not equivalent, although they are treated together in the introduction. In the second section several models are presented, but the relationships between them and what is the criterion to take them into account in this line of research is not clearly established. There are multiple proposals for software quality models and specific models for the web. On the other hand, the OWASP guides are relevant to web application security, not a model of quality. I suggest exposing the theoretical analysis (which includes basic definitions of quality) before the description and justification of the models considered. On the other hand, specific quality concepts/attributes/models could be added in the context of banking systems. In my opinion, devoting so much space to defining the concept of electronic banking, internet banking and then mobile banking is not necessary in the current state of the art and public knowledge of these concepts. I suggest focusing on the research objectives of this particular work. The descriptions of the DESMET methodological framework and the research-action methodology are very brief. It is necessary to establish the objectives of the research beforehand. The conceptual models obtained are the main result of the work. More readable notations should be used (I also suggest putting extended information as an annex to the article or on the web).

Background: • Figures 1 and 2 do not contribute to the understanding of the problem and the solution. Please insert only figures that allow a better understanding of the need. • The order of presenting the information is confusing. First, the theory and previous work section should be addressed in order to have the necessary background and thus understand why the construction of a new application is necessary. • In the introduction, the last paragraph should always account for the structure of the article. This is missing so that the reader has an overview of the paper. • In the domain theory section they mention the definition of CRM, but apparently what they offer as a solution is not an application of this type. This causes confusion in reading. It also seems that they are mixing the definitions with the section where they compare other applications, or which does not favor the understanding of the article. • When indicating the compared applications it is not very clear what criteria were used for their selection. What was reviewed in terms of specialized literature? • The quality of Figure 3 is not suitable for publication. • Figure 4 and its explanatory label are in different positions. Said figure also has quality problems. • The way of displaying the proposed solution is very confusing. It is worth reorganizing the entire section to first explain the process proposed in the development and then the results obtained. • Taking into account the objective of the article, a section on the indicator model of the extension used steals space from more important aspects to be dealt with, such as the usefulness of the application being mobile and having data such as the location of the vendor. • The title of the work does not match the content.

GENERAL EVALUATION: The document does not follow the structure of a scientific article and it does not seem to follow the INFONOR format either. In addition, the presented work seems more like an engineering work than a scientific one. Although this mobile web application could be interesting, it should be mentioned that it does not offer any URL address where to (com)test the presented application. Section 2 should discuss related work and some concepts, but in the middle of this section, part of the proposal is described. In addition, the work defines in almost a column what delinquency is using extensive quotations (“…”). The experiments and results discussion section does not describe experiments or results (the latter are described but not discussed), only some facets/screens of the application are shown. Furthermore, it justifies the use of Android through a very long quote (""...""). MINOR DETAILS: - The abstract in English could be improved, starting by eliminating the first word of the paper. The abstract could be written in Spanish. - The format of the document does not follow the INFONOR standard, especially with the margins, - In some parts of the document, the word “thesis” and not article can be observed.

The problem addressed by the article is adequately supported by the existing needs to provide data to assess transparency and public interest. An applied research is carried out on the main government web platforms in Chile. The objective is declared by the author and establishes that the state of open data in Chile is presented and a diagnosis is made of the main sites and tools provided by the state to improve transparency and enhance citizen participation. The literature review is relevant to the topic but quite general. The model used to measure the quality of data on the web is chosen without justification through an analysis that establishes its efficiency compared to other models. The review that is carried out of the concept of open data is minimal and is not present in the review carried out as this issue has been addressed in different countries and the results they have obtained. The authors should further delve into the concept of open data at the government level for transparency and the public interest and better support this division in the literature. The methodological aspect of the work focuses on using the 5-star model and describing a general classification based on this model. Although this methodological approach is adequate and is clearly associated with the subject, it does not present propositions to be evaluated (research questions or hypotheses to be tested). The diagnosis is basic and general based on four variables that allow each platform to be classified. The author should also establish a categorization of what the study subjects are (the government of Chile is mentioned but there are only four platforms out of the total number of platforms owned by the government). In this sense, it should refer to transversal central service platforms (since it does not analyze local governments at any time).

It uses the CRISP-DM process as a methodological reference and follows it with some dedication. As for the substance: it details too many aspects that are related to the descriptive part of the financial topic and the bank in particular where the development of the work is circumscribed. It also emphasizes obtaining the mineable view, which is fine, but neglects the generation of the data mining model, specifically it does not show the clustering model, nor the levels of coverage and confidence in each rule of each cluster, it does not perform a statistical analysis about patterns and there is no validation of the model and patterns obtained. The latter is the greatest weakness of the work.

If you go to the definition given by the SEI, you will see that it is not the same, the concept of small setting being broader. In this case I think the authors are referring to small businesses. 3) As a third comment, general, check the punctuation marks, very long sentences. In the summary, the authors indicate that they are going to offer a work proposal for small environments. I can't find that job proposal in the article. Also, it is better not to put references in the abstract. In the introduction, second paragraph, it appears ""since this allows to guarantee FROM ..."" an UNTIL SUCH THING is expected... In the systematic review process section, it is not necessary to make a subsection, it does not make much sense to divide a thing in one section. In the systematic review phases grant, they first say there are 3 steps and then they call it phases. Which of the 2 is it??? The names given to the phases do not coincide with those of the following sections, nor with those of Figure 1. Figure 1 does not contribute anything. In the planning section, words like ""over"" are not very valid in written language. Likewise, in the planning they include paragraphs that justify the reason for the SMEs, this is already out of context here. They also indicate that the objective of the review is to find models, methodologies, proposals or processes related to requirements management. Well, this is what they are expected to obtain in the results of the systematic review, and this hardly appears (it only appears a list of methodologies and little else). They also mix improvement of software processes with improvement of requirements management. Then they indicate that the results are measured by the number of proposals... when previously they have said otherwise. The sections of the review do not faithfully follow those of Kitchenham, and Biolchini. Likewise, in the ""search string"" part, ""is that"" appears, which in written language does not look good. The list of sources, why does it appear in the search string grant? In the revision part, Table 3 and Figure 2 are redundant, if one more column is added to the table, indicating the corresponding percentage, we have the same effect. In the Review part, YOU CANNOT DECIDE TO INCLUDE ONLY THE FIRST 20, so why do we do the systematic review???? Also a single grant???. What are the 20 items you selected? Where are they referenced? The same happens with Figure 4 and Table 4. Regarding the Results, it is to be assumed that references 18 to 29 are the primary articles??? In these results they only indicate justifications related to requirements management, but nothing related to what they indicate in the objective of their systematic review. Based on a reference from 2007, number 24, they indicate that it had not dealt with the management of requirements in small companies. I only indicate a doctoral thesis from the UPM of November 2013, entitled Metamodel for the improvement of the requirements management process, whose author is Ariel E. Serrano Rico and Director Jose A. Calvo-Manzano, so that you can see that there are things on requirements management. This is also the only site where they indicate a series of methodologies. This, which is supposed to be one of the expected results, only appears in 2 lines of the results section. Then it adds a series of key factors, and conditions that seem to appear by themselves, without any reference and that are also not the objective that the authors say regarding the review they have made.","2015-07-05"

The most critical thing is the use of 2 SABD (PostgreSQL for weak coupling, and Oracle for medium and strong couplings) in the experimentation, this makes the comparison very debatable, since they no longer only have the implementation of the algorithm as an independent variable , but also the SABD to use.
